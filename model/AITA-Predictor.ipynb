    "# Am I The A-hole Predictor Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based on one of Reddit's most popular section: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/\">r/AmITheAsshole</a>. This subreddit (AITA for short) has a simple premise of having people post about social experiences where they're unsure if they're the one at fault or not. Redditors participate in deciding their judgement, commenting on the situation, giving a brief summary of what they think is going on and argumenting for each of the valid judgements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **YTA** (You're the A-hole)\n",
    "- **NTA** (Not the A-hole, but the other person is)\n",
    "- **ESH** (Everyone Sucks Here)\n",
    "- **NAH** (No A-holes Here)\n",
    "- **INFO** (Not enough information)\n",
    "\n",
    "People vote in their comments, and after 18 hours, a flair is given to each post with the verdict of the public, which then usually translates to the original posters reacting to their judgement, for better or worse (and this is where this subreddit gets one of the juiciest comment sections on the entire website!). However, this being both Reddit and the internet, there are some biases included, and the crowd allegedly tends to pick certain verdicts when the story has some buzzwords or characters which are not as favored in the internet, such as: mothers-in-law, pregnant people, childen being loud, among many others, as well as certain situations where the subreddit is pretty vocal about defending, specially when it includes people asking for help when there's no legal obligation to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I took this perceived notion of being able to predict the outcome when the story is told in a certain way or with certain participates, and a dataset of 100,000 submissions was obtained and processed to obtain some descriptive statistics about posts based on Reddit activity such as comments and up/downvotes to characterize the posts, and build a machine learning model to predict the verdict of a user input text telling a story."
