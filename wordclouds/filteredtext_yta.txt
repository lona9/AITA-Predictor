My GF beautiful hair seems lot low maintenance women I know. She doesn’t use hundred different hair products, blow dry it. It honestly doesn’t take long style hair anything. However, always insist using special towel dry hair. She insists can’t use regular towel hair. She gets mad I use hair towel regular towel too. She says towel used hair. She even bought extra towels keeps drawer place. She also takes towel goes vacation. I usually don’t mind it, since towel doesn’t take much space, better listening hair dryer time. But it’s bit weird I don’t anyone else towel hair. For Thanksgiving, travelled see family. Before trip, I asked GF leave towel home since we’ll staying parents’ house. I didn’t family think weird make fun her. Since planned leave early morning, GF spent night place. I noticed packed towel kept place suitcase. When asleep, I took towel out. She didn’t notice towel gone parent’s house. I thought okay, GF didn’t seem mad whole trip. However, back place, GF car drove without saying goodbye. She texted later saying she’s mad stupid towel needs space. I keep calling texting her, won’t respond. My friends think she’s overly dramatic, GF isn’t type person. Now I’m wondering I messed up.

So (48) daughter (23) blue tongue skink heavily adores. She jokingly refers daughter, I've found weird says closest thing child feels strong emotional bond similar child. She decided remain child free multiple reasons I supportive decision. Well recently took Skink vet checkup excited find Skinks gender. Afterwards I text asking I'd come gender reveal party having. She explained small together cake food friends seen gender reveal mostly joke (and way make fun real gender reveals). Well I come. I see point. It's lizard I'm busy person. She later called expressed kind sad I come cuz it'd since I'd seen understood I busy. I actually expect come gender reveal lizard. She real gender reveal, joke really small gathering catch everyone. I case should've called gathering I'm coming gender reveal unless real grand daughter. She quiet minute turned words around, claiming I supportive decision childfree.

I ridiculous lizard, claimed lizard gathering even centered around lizard, I stick I said. It's ridiculous gender reveal lizard. She hung I message best friend I'm asshole treating way, I think I'm asshole wanting go party lizard? EDIT: In I away I many replies lot read through. Let clear couple things up. 1.

I matters Skink girl I "I'm coming gender reveal unless real grand daughter." 3. Even though I agree daughter childfree, I supportive shown mild frustration. The reasons decided childfree claims asexual, one, emotional baggage feels unable care real child, fears pregnancy, carrier gene "doesn't go I did" (I 4 miscarriages highly defect child died 3 months due gene). Yes slight tension us I think found right man (she never dated growing up) fears unnecessarily exaggerated, ultimately decision I resent her. 4. We seen three months.

Like went thrifting grocery store without (we always go together) I really wanted go badly, I can uber. It’s even I ask rides ever, I tag along she’s already going somewhere. I uber’s work good job.

Because hates driver much, I suggested I lessons *her* birthday, mine, upset even more. She isn’t gift she’d upset I driving lessons birthday.

Although GF grew relatively well off, I’ve known she’s pretty low maintenance. She’s never cared designer brands, rarely buys new clothes, jewellery owns gifted her. I decent job now (80k year) I’ve saving awhile, growing family didn’t lot money. My GF I always seemed page comes saving money. I assumed fine affordable ring. When I started looking rings, I discovered moissanite rings, look similar diamond rings much affordable. I looking rings 1500 -1800 range. When I mentioned insisted wanted real diamond ring sent links bunch diamond rings liked. The prices ranged 6,500-10,000. I I wasn’t willing spend much. She seemed genuinely mad wasn’t “that expensive” We pretty big argument it. I ridiculous ask spend much I thought reasonable that. She I cheap I afford I basically saying wasn’t worth it. I worth 10,000 ring... Eventually GF didn’t care I whatever ring I she’s clearly still mad I going ongoing argument. I’m bit frustrated seems left field. I’ve always known marriage super important I didn’t realize she’d insist diamond ring. So I talked older sister it, despite agreeing diamond rings stupidly priced, sided GF I afford it, didn’t see big deal. She added GF done “so much” I asshole this. What sister means GF “doing much me" really supportive I serious car accident 4 years ago. I broke multiple bones required surgeries. Although I live healthcare covered, I unable work awhile expenses I wasn’t able pay. I dating GF 6 months really me. I couldn’t pay rent let move free helped pay expenses physical therapy I needed. She also helped job uncle VP insurance company (It entry level position I business degree it’s I unqualified). Obviously I’ve thanked it’s something talk much. I think I’m obligated buy expensive ring helped years ago. But sister I’m guessing GF must feel way well. AITA here? Edit: This post way attention I expected. I've definitely reconsidered stance. I'm going talk her. Thanks help. Edit #3 - Don’t steal send TTS make video YouTube likes, animals. Edit #2 - second edit. Not sure everyone getting narrative I ever mentioned anything eating disorder. That never happened. Nor I understand it’s hard understand pulled therapy lying therapist imaginary friend. Therapy won’t help lie, exaggerate entertainment. My daughter 24 *now*. The concussion graduation years ago. The argument around week ago. I see people calling tiger mom. If makes tiger mom expect daughter turn work keep classes, sure. But also we’re white. I’m also disgusted everyone saying I hate daughter. She light life. I gave everything *happily*. I moved deserved better opportunities MA NC, leaving behind parents loved. I’m frustrated, yes, I’m perfect, first baby. I’ve loved since I first found I pregnant, since I first met her, felt her. Yes, I’m frustrated. Incredibly frustrated. I grew tired bad guy love spat face, moved I tired spinning narrative strangers family alike. This may show responses “dripping contempt”. We never placed therapy again, no, lying childhood therapist. It aggressive behavior (*threatening* students!) screaming, immediately playing nice teachers confronted. It lying guidance counselors teachers years (one broke crying, telling teacher didn’t go home, teacher called tore another student’s work - AKA going punished). It constant hypochondria (she constantly “sick” “throwing up”, rarely front us, rarely quantifiable fever 100). Mary go extreme, illogical lengths wanted ones hurt efforts, constantly called meetings schools, taken aside doctors, family friends asking Mary “you know, okay?” She’s depressed. Or autistic. Nor anxiety, ADD ADHD, disorder. I’m arguing judgements happy childhood. Lots love, affection, attention (she child Christ’s sake), support - maybe form wanted still lots support. Just didn’t *kind* support doesn’t mean wasn’t there. There reason depressed. CPS even investigated home found abuse. Case closed. I’m abuser- I’m tired mom everything could. The argument last week started post I asked school days *24* still hasn’t finished degree. In turn completely blew similar fashion comments. (First:) Edit add. She put therapy started acting moving states. Not imaginary friend. The point NEVER imaginary friend therapist asked us friend confronted Mary it. She admitted making then. When daughter “Mary” senior, little school year, “passed out” kitchen. Conveniently I went work father still asleep- usual “sick”. He never heard bang. I use air quotes Mary always dramatic thrived attention. At point, debated getting checked sort disorder, ultimately decided skilled manipulating doctors believe lies even child. Example: six, Mary whole imaginary friend that, father I confronted her, admitted made up. We pulled therapy then. During school years, terror. We constantly embarrassed guidance counselor’s office, pleading case parents best. She didn’t turn homework, behavioral problems, “sick” anyone I’ve ever known be. But back concussion. Immediately incident Mary planted facedown couch texted (apparently screens didn’t bother much then) hit head. I kept asking happened didn’t know, I called kept saying thing, head hurt. She stayed couch bus came went. When father saw there, ended taking doctor first available appointment diagnosed concussion. It lasted past *Christmas*. She cleared go back November half days, worked 4pm later. While I tried try going back full days, gave claimed hurt much, let stay home heal. Well can imagine, less half kids, Mary’s academic success bottom barrel. Plus drop AP courses, far behind. Add fact slacked slept entire days away “sick” constantly college pickings slim. We doubted many acceptances honestly, manage scholarship ‘dream college’ halved costs. (She’d never mentioned before) We far orientation realized even scholarship, financial aid, couldn’t cost. I best brought bank loan, couldn’t needed. She never forgiven us, constantly claiming saved more, rather applied herself, managed better job. I brought herself, warned happen, put effort. I “every assignment never turned dollar pissed away”. She hasn’t spoken us since, she’s ignored every I father tries reach out.AITA sternly telling wife I invite whoever I whenever I house? My wife stahm I work full time. We 2 kids I help %50 care handles cooking cleaning %50 child care well. I'm sociable nature fast making friends wether work outside it. The problem wife I invite friends co workers (guests) every days house dinner lunch. Restaurants option now due budget. My wife cook guests though I never tell cook cook ever complain choice meals depends. The guests eat whatever feels cooking yet complains cook extra people takes effort also since I sit guests serve bringing coffee/preparing table/etc since I I chores I thought since area responsibilities problem?. I invited guests Thanksgiving, 6 people found lost saying I should've consulted first. I need eat whatever cook problem going agree cook large portion 6 extra people aside serving handling hosting much her. I making big deal stop freaking extra plates glasses whatnot. She agree I eventually guests left started yelling saying mine guests server I stop I sternly house I invite whoever I whenever I please called unreasonable react instead welcoming people wanted spend us unlike family cut us completely shouted done beck call forced take care guests terms serving cooking part chors I continue guests I'll step cook I thought quite rude unfair her. We went back forth argument stopped talking started giving silent treatment making feel I'd committed sin guests over. INFO - I wanted explain wife's main issue cooking cook extra guests understandable I tried compromise suggesting set limits guests visit avoid include dinners whatnot also suggested limit frequency visits stated will still issue gave options either handling hosting completely stop take restaurants restaurants consume money advised going restaurants. Also, reason I house I meant house mine alone alone. My wife huge part definitely gets say goes usually diasgree except issue.My wife I 68, I retired 3 years ago, wife is/was nurse went back work a, “change pace”. So first ever I’m work, she’s working. This created bit awkward dynamic since I 0 experience chores (we married moved together 18, I lived mom). So I legitimately never lift finger home til recently. My wife packed lunch kissed goodbye 47 years. She bit shocked discover I won’t same. She’s teach cook, since I little experience (none actually), now thing I can well clean. So issue. But everything else used I’m capable of. She’s less understanding… I feel maybe split chores **We recently argument I haven’t able to, “do I (she) almost 50 years”** Which she’s right, I said….I experience stuff. I didn’t even retire since dad grandpa worked til day died, convinced too. And now I’m stuck here. I’m best. Edit(s): She retrained going back work I expected help way this. She always meticulous housekeeper, even now didn’t expect help, I showed willingness help take care house. To everyone saying working full everything: She SAHM/SAHW huge majority 50 marriage, 55 relationship. I’d say worked (outside home) 7 years total time. She didn’t outright ask help chores first, I felt awkward sitting day leaving messes. So I cleaned them, now sudden expects attempt play housewife. Honestly…it’s easy made look. She still cleans, cooks, grocery shops though it’s needed. In fact, I still haven’t ever grocery shopped. I new found respect housewives. I always appreciated wife, impressed way juggles everything. But now I’m end, isn’t easy seemed. Hi. A couple weeks ago new employee hired company. good guy widower named "James" (36) knowledge late wife passed away 8 months ago. Me (f32) coworkers along well him. However I noticed still wearing wedding band finger. It kind confused bit I help bring lunch break. We talked I pointed misleading still wearing wedding band widower. He looked quite bothered I I tried explain I think giving people wrong idea impression relationship status since technically single right now (don't sound cruel I'm speaking technical angle). James give much thought (meaning care people think) even wearing wedding band woman approached still turn since obviously interested. For reason things awkward everyone stopped eating stared James me. I I really really felt generally misleading making people think relationship (married) regardless felt relationship. He upset, called rude, I repeatedly disrespected marriage late wife's memory I took stuff walked away. My co workers regardless right wrong (though overreacted) reason bring first place cause scene make James upset us now speaking others sided me. AITA? Did I overstep overreact? This conversation casually co workers I use insensitive tones anything discussion suddenly turned argument. I tried let things calm situation hand unexpectedly.So boyfriend (30M) I (24F) together two years, bought first house together. We move end month. My boyfriend four old daughter "Kate" previous relationship. I love Kate heart. She lives BF's ex, comes visit us short stays sleepovers, often summer time. Our new house 30 minute drive Kate's mom's house. It three bedrooms: master bedroom two smaller bedrooms. We converting rooms office BF work from. That leaves spare bedroom. Kate really nervous us moving far away, BF reassured will still visit - will bedroom waiting whenever wants. My issue I Kate treat spare bedroom personal bedroom. Rather, I thought "guest" bedroom. Of course Kate can stay whenever wants to. This part debate, I feel welcome time. But I *only* room. I filled toys clothes, nobody else feels comfortable sleep there. I think fair room reserved someone 90% time. In addition, BF I planning child own, I make sure happens, will space live. I can imagine circus years tell Kate taking away room give new sibling. That's I set expectations now - Kate always welcome, will welcome "guest." My boyfriend thinks I'm unreasonable, Kate needs room stability, especially feels moving away her. He says can keep pull-out sofa office guests stay on, call spare room "Kate's room." I still think fair room Kate use often. And I think reasonable worried prospect eventually giving Kate's room away future child.I sounds bad hear out. So I (27M) mom (45F) never good relationship. My dad (52M) worked lot hours always mom. All nag constantly. It always shit. She never listened I wanted. For example pack really elaborate lunchboxes found I giving friend, really upset even though I I wanted normal foods. To make worse, guilt-tripped packing friend lunch dropped every morning drive school. IT passive aggressive stunt. Long story short, dad coworker clicked things happened mom freaked divorced. I 16 wanted live dad stepmom way chill. She let live nag homework stuff. My mom tried custody judge let decide. My dad stepmom make contact her. A years later, I changed number insurance stuff, moved state, lost contact. She literally already married kid tell me. It 11 years contact people said, couple years touch. So basically lied Recently grandparents anniversary somehow invited mom even though ex. I think show up. She came husband, 5 old kid, "half-brother" My mom married someone without telling kid. I upset even me. I yelled her. I really hurt replaced "perfect, well behaved kid". She going pretend I exist perfect life continue. She threw tantrum left new family. My grandparents asked leave dad stepmom back. They ridiculous us remarried kid. My grandparents knew invited wedding. Now dad mad parents, I'm mad mom, life turned shit. So Reddit AITA? Edit I DON'T CARE THAT SHE REMARRIED AND HAD A KID. I CARE THAT SHE HID IT FROM EVERYONE. Jesus helicopter parent let breathe entire life guiltripped loved much even care look ONCE anniversary party. It's used tell I light life shit. It's I'm son. Now I'm nothing new FAAAMILY new SONN can mother hen shit abandon real person instead perfect dress dollMy husband (64) two kids, daughter (35) son (31), daughter lives different country, low contact us, little her. Their real mother died teens. His son lives 15 minutes away, see time-to-time. He's bad guy, different husband I. I also son (41), successful stock broker, husband's son moderately successful photographer. My son married 3 kids, husband's son still single, usually causes problems Christmas, I spend son family, I expect husband join. We invited son along four years ago, even though try fit in, good fit. He thought appropriate show Jeans t-shirt; I embarrassed, I hardly look anyone eyes. Ever since year, decided invite again, never seemed issue year. We showed home early morning. We plans go son's house around 11:00, really time, dropped gift left. He bought nothing us. Later day, husband texted ask ask enjoyed rest Xmas, replied "Oh right, today was, thanks chocolate 3 minute visit". My husband upset this, I outraged. I wanted contact put place, husband took phone away let go. It's two days now, husband talking again, seem moved past it, I'm still mad. It's fault less successful family, fit us. So, I idiot inviting husband's son Christmas? I think I might slightly be, husband super rich married me, son raised lower class environment, obviously help, time, definitely fault either. I feel conflicted. Just thought I add this, keeps coming up. No, I tell dress code BUT spent enough father, known better. The Jeans also ill fitting look neat all. Also, Xmas take place house son's, also quite embarrassed, (1) setting good example young children, (2) guests well, make favourable impression them.UPDATE: Well, I'm asshole. A big one. You given lot think guys right. I'm trying earn sympathy anything reading comments seeing people's perspectives made realize I real problem here. I apologized cousin, showed thread, talking reading it. We're 100% okay, I expect us be, I hurt her. But working it. Cousin still deciding whether wants comment reddit account since many people asking her. She's sure wants identify account similar full name. OP: My (32M) cousin (27F) phd student--has four years now I think. And honestly since college general personality changed, even new school. One ways I've seen social media (facebook, twitter, instagram). She literally talks grad school academics "theory" (this calls tbh confusing I describe it) stuff that. barely updates life still academic stuff. Think pictures coworkers conferences, meetings "theory reading group," department happy hours, etc. So discussing hardcore academic texts social media professors grad students, sharing pictures academic events. She recently posted big thing excited present "MLA" (couldn't even tell is). Honestly, us cousins used close now us really relate exactly family college stuff that. She's person wants hang out, social media tends minds talk effects things, I think. Anyway, home couple weeks summer bunch us cousins hanging drinks, every now us bunch notifications check phones (no big deal us, rude phone). She text looked phone smiled/laughed bit. So I "get anything good?" "yeah, friend sent really funny meme, here, I'll pull up" I "is going stuff always posting/sharing none us will get? Because I see pretentious crap." She no, "never mind" quiet. I asked wrong says "I realize think I'm pretentious" I "well really social media, ever post stuff barely anyone understands always talking academic life things go to, absolutely comes across pretentious weird obsessed academics think couple degrees makes better." Most cousins laughed that, two cool keep rest us. She quietly finished drink left evening without saying goodbye anyone. She answer texts now. I feel bad I teasing letting social media makes come pretentious AH.I love her, I will marry I feel okay keeping another man's last name instead mine. Her reason wants last name two kids make lot sense since planning children own. **When I asked future children last names can hyphenate two come**s. I'm honestly comfortable this, hate ex, never jerk anything I wife kids name. I knew I signing I started date her, made crystal clear children come first things wanted mind making new family, merging two. Her dad pretty absent life apparently wonderful "new family" I understand trauma important keep children unity spouse, I'll honestly feel unity. We many serious discussions deciding marry agreed pretty much everything recently, last name thing come up. It probably important agreeing children, live, step-parenting dynamics, etc. But first thing willing discuss, I always great communication anything issue position "It's decided, discussion", together two years, never positioned before. AITA accepting this? EDIT: I think important point also children name. Many children parents last names hyphenated facts children name ex bothers me. EDIT 2: My wife hyphenate last last name kids even keeps have. She me, future children last name two don't. I tried that, hard no. EDIT 3: I suggest actually reading post. Many comments clearly read title.[removed][removed] Hi. So husband m32 I f24 expecting first baby together (I'm 7 months in). My inlaws lovely people.

As mentioned, I confined space dog. I flight attendants concerns, since I potentially ended hospital I fly dog.

It's common theme family take Christmas card photos vacations, naturally I wanted take photos away! Here's problem. Jack white, Enephrine's mom black turned looking very, much her. I care race love bio kids. My parents, however, pretty racist. I'm limited contact several reasons never met Enephrine, Christmas card terms. I send card Enephrine *will* make fuss (certain word hard r) child. So plan take picture me, husband, bio kids parents couple relatives, picture Jack's family friends.

My SIL husband always host dinner. They 14 old son (Chase) wife I 2 kids ( 8 Betty, 3 Sarah). During making meal, SIL sent Chase corner store milk. When came back, two bags sweets him. My kids immediately wanted asked. Chase no. I brought sweets house without expecting share cousins. Sarah particular started throwing bit fit sweets favorite. I share. Chase no, went room hide sweets. At point immature I sweets I give dinner. My brother leave Chase alone, share. I pointed caused Sarah tantrum. He sent milk sweets. Sarah eventually calmed dinner, went another meltdown cause Chase opened sweets share. Not one. I called Chase selfish went room locked door. We tried giving slices cake pie continued meltdown till SIL asked us leave cutting visit short. We ended stopped store buy sweets. I think much ask Chase share younger cousins. AITA? Edit: let clear confusion. Chase bought milk sweets money change fact brought sweets house around small cousins. Everyone knows show sweets small children intend share cause going ask. If wife I came house something sweet, share kids enough share. [removed] For context, I (32M) never comfortable around children. As long leave alone, I can area while, I interact much.

For backstory, I'm 17 brother (I'll call Ethan, real name) 10. Ever since COVID hit, super annoying always wanting spend me. I can understand certain degree, able see friends much made turn friendship. But things really hard relate spend him. I'm reading philosophy listening classic rock. Ethan likes play Fortnite obsessed TikTok rappers Travis Scott... anyways, mom noticed trying spend every Sunday makes take lunch ice cream neighborhood restaurants. I kind think waist gonna lead friendship anything (because different), sometimes laugh two Sunday lunches. Anyways, onto story. Yesterday eating lunch diner biggest crush school walks sees us. Immediately I already embarrased seen him, I tried keep cool. My crush comes asks can sit I say yes. She chats bit tries little bro. She asks likes tells "I really playing Fortnite watching Marvel Movies." At point I'm rolling eyes I doubt crush even knows stuff is. She says "Oh thats cool" something I can tell forcing it. I try change subject keeps going back Ethan reason. Eventually starts asking friends says "Well best friend world brother" looks I wanted sink seat. Idk came I angrily "We're friends, I'm hanging I to". Of course, starts cry embarassing us. My crush really saying anything. So I made something needing bring home I walked back home him. He mom happened mom grounded (I'm literally 17 still grounding me). And disappointed nicer brother. So I feel guilty making cry I think grow bit rely friends, rather clinging trying embarass front someone I like. Am asshole?I bit complicated relationship husband's family. MIL claims likes think does. She also claims loves adores grandchildren, will pretty much anything avoid spending them. As result relationship pretty strained see holidays occasional family dinner. I really holidays MILs house formal. Everyone dresses super nice, hair makeup perfect. MIL pretty much lives stuff. Despite annoying dress code husband gets see siblings, kids see cousins, MIL mostly ignores us anyway. This spend Christmas laws I getting annoyed clothing aspect months. It seems silly almost weird competition women family. I broached topic MIL holidays supposed special generation lazy. That annoyed me, I talked younger women also small kids. One SIL I ruining Christmas. One kind agreed worth fight mom. MIL called recently demanded I talking behind back guests. I explained I trying see people felt it, formal attire another layer stress spiraling sad beauty pageant (I've heard MIL make comments look perfect coming) MIL tacky ask around I need stop trying change family I'm rude entitled thinking I make changes I married in. This pissed I can wear whatever, I will coming sweats kids will play clothes. MIL actually laughed problem, hers. My husband says I I will embarrass him, though I'm seriously thinking MIL still pissy I talked guests "behind back"My (f57) son (m28) recently approached upset something sister (f30) past apparently still resentful (although never spoken it). My daughter always anxious young age (5ish) lot weird rituals make feel better. These rituals often required husband I participate generally went along make happy. In middle school stopped habit developed new lie frequently husband. At point almost month behind school teacher reached blindsided she’d deceiving us everything fine (she also lie things bf secretive) When grade 7 I saw computer browser she’d googling ocd. I questioned thought wanted go doctor, using childhood habits proof. I felt lying excuse school performance ‘no She intermittently argued us 2 years. At point I discovered reading journal she’d also gone behind backs guidance counsellor school woman wouldn’t help her. I grounded lying months later take doctor. She lesss treatment since then. My son recently asked I really “denied medical treatment”. To making sound I negligent really liar that’s didn’t take initiallly. We paid specialists supported years I think putting blame me/making look bad son nand taking responsibility. I upset sneaky behaviour confront husband leave it. My daughter wonderful childhood I hate complaining past behind back— best help her. She never mentioned anything still resentful.To summarize, I (32F) argument something ridiculous now everyone's mad me. When sister (26F) 17, pregnant baby girl. Obviously since young, exactly ready raise kid, family best help out. She currently stable job living child child's father apartment. The issue since baby young, never really experience life. I'm childfree always enjoying new life experiences I sister jealous it. The day I came daughter's birthday party talking baby. At point started argue raised I said, "Don't ever think life would've better never born?" It turns daughter earshot heard everything really upset. My sister defensive child best thing ever happen her, called AH, kicked party. She blocked number talk now. My mom saying I apologize dad agrees this, says sister overreacting. Maybe I bit aggressive I I I true. AITA I did?I work security guard. I scheduled start working new store today, starting 10AM - I guess store opens. I exactly 10AM, ask place belongings backroom. I room minutes max, came back man door. However, I guess many customers already come sales staff play security. On lunch break, manager store approached asked next I come little bit earlier next I put belongings I can front store 10AM. I no, I'm rostered start 10AM I will show 10AM, come earlier store arrange security company. I'm getting paid come earlier I really see I'm required to. She huffy sales staff trained security, popularity store every morning will people lining waiting go inside, I needed earlier that. She really hard come minutes earlier, fair come "just time". I hard come little earlier, I feel principle - someone come earlier make clear hours. I sighed walked away. We talk rest day. So AITA coming work "just time"?I mom two girls, Sierra (12) Emily (10). Both girls absolutely beautiful curls went waist length. I've never personally able grow mine long I never bear cut. Emily never complained started bugging Sierra nine decided join local girls' soccer team. She needed tied back also rather thick, snaps continuously break hassle. She wanted cut back managed work solid way braid hair keep coming loose, stopped complaining it. Two weeks ago, incident school kid stuck bunch loose pieces paper Sierra's hair. It major deal Sierra upset I go talk school it. Unfortunately, Sierra's *very* shy kid giving lot issues since started middle school. The school promised deal it, leaving, Sierra asked I'd take hairdresser's hair cut. I meltdown, telling sick kids mess hair even anyways I listen her. She pouty rest weekend Emily went father's week, Sierra came back hair gone. It cut little chin length. Of course, I happy. I called ex acted though I wrong, saying I obviously care Sierra I let go long. I take Sierra's tablet going behind back this, I otherwise talked ex avoided getting far I another meltdown. Sierra tears pickup today, telling kids telling looks boy. I obviously comforted her, I haircut decision, I'd advised it, now deal consequences actions. She upset stormed lock room home. She come meal speak me, I think I might little harsh. I wanted consider actions, make upset. AITA? To start I mention unlike wife I good relationship mom. And siblings can always afford pricy gifts mom I decided gift something nice expensive Christmas though I'm currently unemployed I work past months wife I joint account. The problem began wife found I purchased $600 dollar necklace mom gift Christmas using joint account- She went saying I should've taken money joint account uses pay bills rent especially now struggling. I asked I tell since us reminded despite true (1. I longer work (2. 600 lot I should've consulted reasons (1. I feel money I can make purchases using joint account (2.

She responded longer joint account since I longer earn money I gift mom expensive items needed earn money. She insisted I return I escelated calling bitter control pointed I never anything price range. She's insisting I return least cheaper I'm done least expensive/valubale gifts gift family. She making hill die on. Aita?[removed]I two kids, son Ben (44) daughter Emma (42F). Their father I divorced young. He wasn’t good husband isn’t bad man. He wealthy. He didn’t bond Emma favored Ben. It became overt grew up. Ben easier Emma well school sports. Emma, although smart, wasn’t interested school rebellious teenager. Their father spoiled Ben and, I’m honest, wasn’t nice Emma. This upset cry, feeling unfairly treated. I felt bad I couldn’t anything felt better pretend wasn’t happening hope better. It didn’t, wanted nothing although wasn’t reason why. Emma struggled cope I think expected stand I hate confrontation father never listens anyway. I preferred discuss Emma focus things I didn’t allow upset didn’t validate her. I didn’t potentially cause bigger rift cause Ben side father. Ben, hand lavished anything wanted, money, cars. He expected successful father. As adults relationship Ben Emma fizzled sad I couldn’t anything it. Despite given large amount wealth opportunities most, Ben hasn’t become successful quite resentful it. His father stopped giving money years ago partially blames I father given much. Despite easy child, Ben grown rather difficult, temper sensitive lack career success, aren’t allowed talk it. Emma stay home mom. She’s good mom children’s father earns lot money. Her father regretful reconnected her. They relationship, quite superficial I think healed wound bit Emma reached Ben. They along well couple years Ben stopped speaking Emma. Emma upset thinks it’s Ben doesn’t father’s interest her. Ben hasn’t given explanation silly reason, doesn’t make sense. I Emma I think Ben behaved badly. She asked I that. I shouted I never stuck protected I can’t doesn’t relationship me. That I enable behavior expense she’s sick tired it. The thing Emma 3 kids Ben 1 kid. Emma will still allow good relationship kids Ben made difficult see kid past angry I’m afraid will stop speaking me. I also don’t forced middle I won’t it. AITA?I (25F) two children, son (4) daughter (2). Raising two children young age really difficult, however, I able graduate college good degree start career I happy with. Despite this, struggle trying juggle responsibility looking kids focusing career stressful say least. My fiancé (26) also works full time, compounds issue. Up now, parents watching children Saturday nights fiancé can ourselves. My parents retired. I recently offered promotion work. While I enjoy new position, involves working hours, makes home life difficult. I parents I'd really appreciate watch kids Tuesday Thursday nights well, alleviate stress levels. However, refused, saying "more enough" looking kids Saturday night. We argument this, parents threatened stop watching kids Saturday night. This annoyed me, I responded saying going put compromising position, going come wedding. We spoken since, I've look kids Saturday night, stressful fiancé. I feel though since retired, nothing wrong asking pull weight help kids. Am I missing something? AITA?Some important details - My wife shy enjoys giving gung ho showing appreciation workers assume appreciated recognized. tries pass beliefs onto kids. silent show appreciation gifts, usually baked goods. I've embarrassed past. oldest rode school bus first time. wife waiting stop daughter hand bus driver bag homemade cookies. picked stop afternoon, gave bag afternoon driver. I asked easily thank left that. bus drivers work hard comfort nervous kids handling unbehaved driving deserve thanks. I reminded embarrassed past I think behaviors extreme. I gifts someone I know. ignored I felt. I contacted people life see I crazy friends mom agree, wife's way showing thanks makes everyone uncomfortable. AITA?I (31f) married Dan (39m) 7 years Nick together (4m). Dan daughter Mel (11f) mother passed away childbirth. We met Mel 1. &#x200B; Mels grandparents Tim Kim (maternal) used part lives.

I'm searching highly competitive field (think finance), yesterday first I interviewed somewehre. I took small shot absinthe I woke up, settle nerves little. (Side note - Grandad Czech origin, LOVED absinthe. He even used brew himself. My final birthday present novel 200 ml bottle brought homeland. Unfortuantely, passed away couple weeks ago, I decided pour ensure good luck interview.) However, I sat company's waiting room, effects completely worn off. I started feel sick nerves - pressure interview stage getting months writing applications. I decided sneak toilet take couple pre-interview shots calm nerves. The interview followed actually went really well - I great chemistry interviewer, laughing, flirting etc. The problem came I, stupidly, decided sneak another shot (for good luck) final interview CEO. Sadly, emerged office precisely I mid-gulp. She looked horrified, leave building. I tried explain anxiety, I simply medicating it, listen called security take away. Afterwards, I sent company apology e-mail asked another chance, yet replied. My mother thinks I'm asshole drinking called alcoholic, (she really understand alcohol,) brother 'doesn't see issue' long I drunk. So Reddit - asshole? Me drinking job interview, CEO lady listening / calling security?I (33F) son Alfie (9M). My sister Erinn (26F) married. On invitations asked wedding remain childfree. I personally agree childfree weddings I respect Erinn's choice I arranged friend come watch Alfie day. The day wedding friend called really sorry feeling well think watching Alfie. I really appreciate mindful (especially ended finding Covid). But left inconvenient place option I even thought line I leave noon (friend called 6:30). I really else I ended taking Alfie me. It big wedding I end talking Erinn reception, good pissed me. She reminded wedding kids, good reason seeing parents "too focused Alfie". He's 9yo boy grown-up wedding going to, I hardly think reasonable us acknowledge well doing. I sitter fell Erinn's husband "that's problem." She going drop regardless explanation I gave, mom ended taking Alfie home dad stayed wedding. At point mood ruined I honestly I left. Erinn still claiming I owe apology, I'm sure I maliciously foisted Alfie her. If civil little boy I think says far her. And 4mo daughter there, even childfree Erinn's part either.

Mine 16M, 15M, 13F I 50/50 mother left 8 years ago. Hers 16M, 15M, 13M, 11M 7F. I met December last year. She widowed November. We engaged 2 weeks ago front kids happy. Then kids went mother’s house regular week her. While I married wife. It wasn’t big wedding, nice evening waterfront. Her kids grandparents mine mother. I talked several times week I usually do. When came home mother’s house, daughter noticed I wearing wedding ring. At point kids married. Then BBQ cake. My kids say I’m AH inviting them. My wife says wanted it’s ok weren’t there. I might asshole though kids wedding.My husband daughter existed majority life, recently visit mom put nursing home (or something similar) due health, daughter us indefinitely. She's 12. I 11yo son (not husband's), lot life structured around him. He massive room washroom, expecting live us, guest room. She's upset that. My son martial arts, hockey swim already hard us everything, I husband I also take soccer lacrosse. She thinks I'm favouring son. Other issues promised son things her, either tell break promises son. I break promises him. My husband says son quit sports make room daughter's schedule, let go things promised planned needs give room. I disagree. AITA?My mother husband hate other. That's basic way put it. Truth husband feels treated less sibling's spouses skin colour, mother feels way dumb standards. However, I personally feel mother show favouritism harsh treatment husband. Because this, husband stand mother recently begun even room her. "Oh mom's going Christmas? I'm going friend's house." "Oh mom's going kid's event? I'll stay home." Frankly insanely demoralising me, I hate husband backs something mom going there, worse demands mom go wants there. In opinion, big issue, leave kid's events. Recently kids big football match wanted father there. My mother also wanted I tried telling son father there. He adamant, I husband mother going there. He arrives, obviously, mother, immediately bickering. He makes comment racist mother is, fires back saying never racist. I shut sent husband sit somewhere else while. I decided since game ended late, bring mom back home make dinner. My husband threw hissy fit screaming always "choosing mother him" I like, "of fucking course going put mom husband. She's woman singlehandedly raised 3 kids. She's literally goddess giving us adoption." My husband stormed left wondering I've done something wrong. AITA? I 3 kids, Raimondo (23M) Jonibella (20F) Wren (9M). Raimondo graduated May college Jonibella week ago decent community college. This big occasion husband I decided graduates IPad $100 Visa card. (I isn’t much it’s tight since pandemic hit, understand this.) However, I really felt Wren something trooper. He’s much younger them, getting watch achievements still far him, I wanted I noticed appreciate it. So I went ahead bought IPad, well new Switch couple games since he’s younger might much use Visa card. I gifts graduation party since I figured friends/family watch. Everything good close end party Jonibella cornered me, asking I “shower” Wren new electronics isn’t even graduating. I can hard grow sibling’s shadow (I’d know, I three myself), I gave presents graduating good kid graduation festivities. I it’s lot kid I wanted Wren didn’t go unnoticed. Jonibella sentiment fine I bigger gifts either graduate. I I wanted presents everyone I trying conscious again, pandemic really took hit us. She “why don’t tell favorite” stormed off. I don’t favorite Jonibella think is. She’s barely anything since it’s frosty. She says doesn’t anything say I apologize “prioritizing baby” her. My husband thinks understanding hasn’t experience can’t speak it, I don’t return gifts Wren overjoyed I’m glad see happy. But I’m really wondering I line trying please everyone.[removed]I 47m 2 sons past marriage. Abel 16 Michael 15. When I remarried six years ago Abel accepting great new stepmom Laurie.

She chronic pain condition probably impacted caffeine intake, making harder routine things, leaving pick slack. When I've mentioned it, says doctor believe caffeine intake affects condition - really point, overall health impaired less restful sleep. This week I decided household coffee-free, discarded coffee machine pods. I wife drink coffee, cafe way work (this financial hardship, I rarely drink coffee home anyway). My wife mad "policing" habit enjoys considers harmless. I noticed gone bed smoothly since coffee left home, continues angry short me, I'm beginning wonder I went overboard.

I entire night planned out, going trying lobster first time. Where conflict arises cake. I always wanted penis shaped cake since I thought funny, I wife react. However, since 10th anniversary, I figured used crude sense humor. I went ahead cake couple days advance put fridge. However, wife snuck peek pleased. She really mad me, accused trying ruin special night. I thought ridiculous, mad ever since. Apparently spoke family it, blowing phone ever since (they're mostly conservative Mormons). I still think I anything wrong trying something nice her, I realized I might TA I offered another cake yet since mood kind ruined.[removed]So basically I rented nice venue (plus catering & drinks) birthday party partying, I noticed friends boyfriend disappeared while. I asked anyone knew people shrugged. About 10-15 minutes later, friend boyfriend emerged bathroom looking quite “disheveled” (idk else put looked flushed hair bit messy). So, I took friend side asked point blank bathroom sex boyfriend now looked shocked “how tell?!” I rolled eyes “it wasn’t hard put together.” Then, I kinda waited moment apologize didn’t. And I said, “are going say sorry?!” Then basically nothing sorry didn’t affect party all. I bit drunk I ended getting mad asking boyfriend leave immediately. I personally don’t think I wrong annoyed friends implied I overreacting getting angry kicking out. Also, defense, party almost anyway. It ended hour later. The next day, I feel bit bad outburst I can’t help think I never would’ve done something someone else’s party. Am I asshole? Additional info initially included: 1. There 14 people total (yes, including parents). Everyone else early mid-20s. 2. This took place venue meant small-ish events hotel. Catered restaurant within hotel. 3. The bathroom restaurant's bathroom, private event. 4. Definitely booze-filled rager also suuuper fancy dinner. (I wearing nicest shirt pants suit/tuxedo helps) EDIT! (Didn't I I'll update happened) ***After going comments, I came conclusion us a-holes I bigger I called apologize. ****For suggested either us cut off, let lesson acting messy drunk reason end good friendship! The outcome is... WE MADE UP! We agreed neither us done drinking. It also first real party due pandemic maybe affected behavior badly. Both us apologized I also showed thread (Can't believe blew much haha). It seems sex bathroom party kind litmus test (idk tho). Surprising revelations side story: THEY WERE HAVING MAKE-UP SEX! She estimates gone 40 min. Within time, huge argument bathroom made (by hooking up). She thinks waiter came heard sure. Random thought: whole ordeal would've made great reality tv lol. *Note (I many people will read but): I tell everyone party I kicked out. I decided leave early. Then afterwards, I 3 friends actually happened. These friends I overreacted. Turns out, right. :)I (26m) married wife (24f) around 8 months. We recently bought home packing moving apartment new house. For whatever reason wife mom (53f) really connected. This seems bother mother, I two older sisters married great relationship husbands. So busy packing moving mom showed started kind insert efforts, asking help. I "Actually, mom, I think pretty much this. But thank you." But persisted, helping us pack boxes. While wife I loading boxes back truck mom "Here, try this; I think will work better." This whatever reason set wife snapped "Look, need help. Stop forcing this. We it. I need tell load belongings. Leave us alone." I honestly will never forget look hurt mom's face. She bowed left. Afterward I asked wife "Was really necessary?" She responded "Maybe I mom frustrating. She quit." A couple days later incident look mom's face still mind, I decided invite mom dinner local restaurant likes tell I sorry. I without talking wife first, afterward also attend meal tell mom sorry wanted to. My wife vehemently declined dinner disrespectful her; mom pushy owed apology. She I "mama's boy." I I'm mama's boy I'm going stand woman gave life sat whenever I fever disrespected; even wife, mom meant well owed apology. My wife upset me. AITA?Yesterday, I went Target buy clothes myself.

SIL messaged husband, communicating, telling I ruined they’re special news it’s manipulative, future child will take priority children may full well grown they’re even allowed child. It’s become issue; husband SILs side honestly I’m still upset? They’ve children moment may getting baby children pushed away didn’t even decency tell us face face. AITA?So boyfriend live together fairly large rented house, despite fact neither us children. The house 4 decently sized bedrooms, bedroom, office. The two empty. Despite fact kids, avid pet lovers, 3 old Rottweiler, old Bulldog, well 7 old cat. Yesterday, brother asked watch children, since go hospital due wife breaking leg. I available time, brother dropped children (a 9 old boy 7 old girl) house. Unfortunately, arrangement suitable us, since made plans drop dogs doggy spa went mall. I called friend, agreed look kids (I compensated monetarily, even though need to). My brother never met friend, I'd never leave child dangerous position. While mall, brother calls ask are. I kids friends house. He furious me, hung phone soon after. Around 30 minutes later, friend calls say brother picked kids up, irate, say least. My brother tried call since, I picked phone, since I likely wants argument me. Today, dad called ask I'd chosen "dumb dogs" nephew niece, irritated me. I dad I feel sorry wife, responsibility drop everything look children even mine. I also going insult family, expect walk isle.

In short, I really chance respond. My brother phoned route hospital tell needs someone watch kids due wife breaking leg. Around 5 minutes later turns house kids, saying go hospital.This happened pre-covid. I doctoral candidate sent several colleagues, well professor, conference important community. The conference held Germany participants occupied entire hotel. Just clear: guests hotel attending conference. The hotel spa, custom Germany, spa no-bathing suits-allowed policy, posted entrance. You miss it. The conference hugely international, key speakers mostly Nobel laureates. On second day conference, newly made friends decided check spa. This work conference, I wore bathing suit. It strapless I towel obvious, many others joined (probably little twenty PhD students), straight rocking bathing suit. We whole hotel ourselves, fuck go naked work meeting? Well, turns out, female professors. When walked area spa was, alone totally nude, flipped fuck us. Several us actually *her* students, rest us basically knew reputation alone. She mortified beyond pissed exposed was. After finished shrieking us, left complained professors well hotel staff. Nothing came I guess reactions I hear it. We ended enjoying next four days spa bathing suits, along sometimes also bathing suit-claden professors sometimes also children. The professor who'd complained left conference day return, I think may assholes.[removed][removed]My sister thinks I’m ah I’m confused I be. I buying bagel thursday noticed cashier rather pretty. She tattoo probably least 18, looked around 19-20. After I made order, I complimented saying “you you’re gorgeous right?” And shock, gave blank stare looked kind disgusted. I tried make conversation I boats asked ever one, etc, “you’re done order right? I think we’re done here.” She didn’t even give thank you. And gave nasty look. I really don’t think crude nasty compliment reaction shocking. I sister weird give sort compliment girls looks considering I’m 58, I wasn’t flirting I complimenting her. She proceeded tell I shouldn’t make comments workers they’re awkward situation. AITA complimenting cashier? Tl;dr: I gave compliment cashier disgusted I’m wondering I’m AH Edit: I guess people don’t COMPLIMENT nowadays manners are. The polite thing receiving compliment say “THANK YOU” least smile nod. Was trying nice cashier I pitied honestly. She full I’ll going back let needs lower ego.My younger daughter (12) ADHD inattentive type. She bouncing-off-the-walls stereotype, rather, struggles go head, finds extremely difficult focus schoolwork, zones frequently etc. Recently exam, managed score A every subject. This first achieved this, husband I proud brought dinner + bicycle, something wanted while. My older daughter (15) upset 'favoritism', always straight-A student never 'showered praise' sister. I tried explain sister faced difficulties never deal I asked understanding, plus I also reminded always brought nice (and expensive) dinner whenever came back good results. We bit argument kept bringing bike, even though I repeatedly stated perfectly reasonable reward. Things tense us, husband agrees mother tells I'm playing favorites, I really think I am. It's also worth mentioning difference way I treat daughters I'm actually strict youngest, needs prompting start finish tasks. AITA? Edit: Thank comments. Just clear things up, yes oldest bike, yes something first As. I feel struggle different areas, proper fair reward give oldest extra present reaches milestone area struggles much sister. However, I also see oldest may felt achievements undervalued, might internal struggles I'm properly dealing parent. I will sit I will discuss things her.[removed]Throwaway course. &#x200B; Not sure matters, I (45F) married husband Henry (45M) multiple children together, Oldest twins Christian (17M) Elizabeth (17F).

Chris part enthusiastic all. Near end night dance Liz brother, show up, even announcer repeated name thrice. My daughter left alone started crying I absolutely furious. I believe her. I tried call cell blocked everywhere. &#x200B; After getting home, twins never spoke again. Liz adjusted fine. Chris however struggled behavioral issues everyone else family distanced aside brother. I’m sure happened, school came around (Sept 2021), took complete 180. He gotten perfect score subject never liked able comprehend material of. His teachers thought cheating, honestly, I confronted it. He seemed angry question dismissed say word me. Anyway, last night I received email senior pictures yesterday wanted two take pictures together, important milestone, Liz refused called cheater. Chris retorted called jealous now better something associate shitty family anyway, made snap him. I everyone put bullshit long blame wanting interact family horrible thing, called AH. Henry stepped felt way talked us way allowed house anymore. He ended going room calling uncle staying him, nowhere, brother starts calling asshole claiming I always clear bias fault twins ended way, I firmly reminded Christian ruined sister's party! I even bias either children. To honest getting point, I sounds fake, I really wish was. I really need know, I possibly AH here? &#x200B; PS: There many things I could've included would've long, I willing clear things comments.Back round brother (32M) makes sense: He 1st family finish high school. When applyed college high school excepted any. He tried next 1 college. The college Rank Not Published ranking system means itss low publish number respect. Its also college 95% people easiest America. Then finished college tried Medical school. He interview much less getting school. The next tried 1 single school wait list 1st. It Rank Not Publish meaning lowest America. And also even Medical doctor called D.O. instead. If search D.O. Google easy see thats good Medical doctor. After Medical school residency job. Which need order doctor. He wait another try again. Then Psychiatrist least respected medical field according Google. Also easiest residency jobs get. The state residency job easiest ones America Medical license. He finished residency job summer real job. That state also 1 easiest Medical license. His new job gave bonus joining enough downpayment house middle where. The Real Estate super cheap almost anyone can afford it. My point great doctor went good collage Medical school Havard. He never always try 2nd time. He great kind medical field surgery state hard license. And owns house place almost anyone can afford to. Not places Real Estate expensive. In residency job finished house real job ready came visit. Since room parents (52 M,F) sleeping here. He need talk new job I (33F) already it. But talked start date I kept telling knock b/c great mighty failed every step way always easiest things. He "its rich say so" I kicked out. Our parents agreed left park together. He think I apologize I think so. If Medical doctor good college hard job surgery expensive house maybe different. He coming back unless apologize barely stays touch. He thinks I'm TA I think (so parents btw). Which us right TA?I (F61) 5 sons I always wanted best them, go college, married, children successful nice human beings. I think I right thing raising them. Between children, two part lgbt community, gay bisexual. My older son (M41) trouble settling relationship wonderful guy. His ex honest, family oriented, successful lawyer, planning married, unfortunately broke almost three years ago. My son recently started dating guy I don’t even know, he’s 13 years younger son. As far I job, he’s young son. It's I guy, I feel son compatible. My son well educated, he’s successful I don’t guy take advantage him. Meanwhile guy normal job, ridiculous impolite. This boy class, he’s ridiculous inappropriate. I youthful way dresses, mannerisms him, I consider rude. I many mothers can relate situation. It’s obvious he’s compatible son. My son brought boyfriend Thanksgiving I invited them, dinner son’s boyfriend asked I wanted help. I I didn’t need help anyway. My daughter-in-law pregnant, I talking receives baby will new member family, replied “we actually two new members family” referring son's boyfriend. So I really new member son's boyfriend part family yet. What I referring reality boy part family married son yet. My son called complaining spoken boyfriend that, called classist asked apologize. I logical, they’re married. He will part family gets marry son… AITA logical?My daughter Stephie turned 9 Saturday. She's asking Switch now, I think gotten old enough mature enough I can trust big present that. So plan always give Stephie Switch birthday party day. However, ended falling through. We ended able pick Switch Sunday morning. See, Stephie invited classmate Jolene's party Sunday. So I figured since still party spirit, I give Stephie Switch cake Jolene's party. Nothing that. Just unwrapping spotlight right back Jolene. Besides, girls friends I figured big deal. They're 9, old enough understand extenuating circumstance. Or I thought. Everything went I planned I thought went well, party I call Jolene's mom essentially asking hell I thinking. That I "undermining" afford something Switch Jolene. Correct I'm wrong I raised Stephie even really care things much present costs. Also, Jolene even care numerous new things play with, Stephie shared Switch seems everyone made well. Jolene's mom also called petty show-off (she I another I sugarcoat it, I put aside kids issues fault, Jolene's mom definitively doing). Husband says gets I coming maybe least waited Jolene's presents opened first. That's fair I'm sure quite makes AH Jolene. AITA?Throwaway account Some background info: I (50 F) 2 adult kids Mike (30) Marie (29) married. The last 5 years split Christmas kid spouse will come day another day. This worked work schedules spouse family Christmas gatherings. Now onto issue I texted yesterday asking can still come Christmas Eve. Mike yes Marie aware I planning gathering come due work husband's family gathering. We Christmas Day either Mike wife family gathering. So I asked Sunday work Marie yes Mike unless later evening since work. I trying beg bit family I texted I'd leave presents porches since family anyway seems family matter, spouses families. They tried calling texting I ignored them. Later husband convinced Sunday 3. I kids since care family anymore will last family Christmas good. I'm dealing family forgotten kids. Marie stop asshole stop acting martyr. I really think I'm wrong though. My kids ones making family. So, AITA?[removed]I never loved daughter. Not really. I always hated idea children wife (but mostly me) super careful. One way though, pregnant. I happens sometimes, wife didn’t rid baby. We talked bit eventually agreed keep baby I didn’t make feel something didn’t to, especially child. So boom, baby. Except baby, didn’t seem taking care much have. Sometimes I come home work baby alone wife nowhere seen. I didn’t baby live life neglected us never give chance good childhood, I tried take care baby I could. Admittedly, I bad it. I didn’t take care baby, something I begun researching confirmed baby. I also never really mentally prepared care baby, I never wanted and, truth told, really despised children taking care them. But regardless, I still tried take care wife wasn’t around, lot time. Fast forward 15 years, daughter now 15 years old. I taken care child, put school, spent money I worked kid I never even wanted, 15 years now. And wife still seems absent child. One evening, eating dinner wife talking “how good baby raised”. I snapped never raised baby selfish pushing choice me. Everything quiet sort left. I never present daughter I guess everything past years boiled over. But mostly, I feel bad saying front daughter. I don’t feel she’s responsible blame wife’s relationship. I live good life I don’t conflict ruin her. So, AITA?Her kids sleepover. We’ve always picture family really young, FIRST kids ever asked it. She also seen picture never commented it. They asked picture. My sister started transitioning high school I don’t really think “trans.” Like I wasn’t always woman old pictures pictures me. And I sort assume people it’s big dark secret. Naturally, I responded honestly. I mom, daughter looked boy, I was. I tried explain boy now she’s son thought funny, made daughter really upset. I surprised kept them. It didn’t come that, husband picked kids eventually neither kid seemed upset it. Overall pretty good sleepover. A hours later, I husband phone asking I calling “insane.” He sister “distraught.” He saying I outed cruel was, kids pure. Outing means nothing can teach empathy understanding. There’s nothing afraid of, outed kid. Still I her, I apologized for. I eventually phone she’s really upset understands I didn’t mean cause harm. I asked ever planning tell kids wasn’t sure. I SHOCKED that. My sister isn’t typically dishonest person. AT ALL. Both kids even they’re adopted. I I kids favour, I believe, I’m never sorry anything. I think outing horrible, situation, justified? My husband also agrees it’s kind lie left children distrustful future. UPDATE: Okay, I'm wrong. The people agreeing majority extremely rude transphobic sister. I'll apologizing her. Please understand I make place transphobes spout rhetoric.[deleted]I (F 58) will always mother twin sons, “Thomas” “Sam.” In summer graduated, 18, Thomas passed away. I can’t begin explain broken I was. At point, Sam already accepted offer go Ivy League school. My husband I 100k saved boys, Sam’s school expensive money wouldn’t cover it. Before Thomas passed, Sam fine taking student loans cover rest. Then lost Thomas. Less two months happened, Sam asked 100k set aside Thomas. I lost him. I Thomas’s money his, deserved go Thomas. This I might AH, Sam used money. But didn’t cent it. To fair, husband I didn’t cent either. We donated various charities drunk driving memory Thomas. That 10 years ago. Sam took student loans, he’s young already successful lawyer. I believe he’s paid loans now (possibly all?). If matters all, husband I contributed significant amount (about 50k) law school tuition well. I thought past it, day, Sam brought unfair refuse give Thomas’s money. We tearful argument it, now I don’t think. If I again, I still don’t think I give money Sam. Does make AH? Edit: people confused way I worded things, here’s better explanation money. We 2 separate college accounts boys. Each account 100k it. After Thomas passed, Sam still 100k always knew he’d get. He didn’t additional 100k Thomas’s account. We never took money away Sam. We didn’t give extra money wouldn’t Thomas alive.I work job socializing networking important. I make good money right now, lot ambition rise higher current company.

When married, wife I agreed I sell house move there’s living space. Stepson already room, daughter extra bedroom, smaller his. It fine first, daughter lot stuff soon became small cramped her. Stepson also lives us part (5 days us, 9 days bio dad) huge room dad’s. My daughter lives us full room. It seemed logical thing daughter larger room since stuff, spends here. Wife hesitant first felt stepson upset feel he’s pushed aside, I convinced daughter needed space ultimately agreed. We ended switching rooms week, freshly painted wife shopping stepson’s new room he’d feel special. He came home dad’s surprised new room. He reacted ok, thanked us new stuff didn’t seem upset first. But now he’s moping cold us. Wife now regretting choice upset convincing fine. AITA?I (23M) dated girlfriend (19F) little now. I’ve come love lot love language gift giving. My girlfriend always type girl that’s hard love. She’s definition magnetic. Guys always approach understandably, she’s high caliber girl. She easily anyone’s dream girl. Looks amazing everything feminine, hands comforts makes food. She “expensive” look her, self care self amazingly cost efficient it. As result, kinds guys go usually trust fund babies highly ambitious (med school, law school, business start-ups, things that), despite anywhere tax bracket. This isn’t fault I’ve seen never entertains anyone affect people. It makes feel less man I’m nothing guys honestly makes feel bum. One day walking past computer, I notice looking designer perfume I I’ll her. She’s adamant doesn’t kind day/dreaming it. Shes literally never asked anything I wanted show I can take care spoil too. I look perfume 300 fucking dollars. What fuck. I don’t see point something honestly pride hurt I went back word, I find perfume much greater value eBay. Today comes I gift perfume. She unwraps present, sprays hand smell face blank expression, shes trying decide react. I ask what’s wrong gives hug kiss cheek, thanking I wanted something nice. I don’t why, made feel shit, I expecting much bigger reaction. I keep pushing seems doesn’t gift tells loves idea, it’s obviously fake. I feel extremely ungrateful thing say I called brat even caring perfume fake not. I also she’s materialistic due fact supposedly even tell fake merely looking smelling once. She says it’s dumb made big show getting I going this, nothing original perfume couldn’t even considered imitation. I think shouldn’t matter I practically still perfume wanted, I didn’t drop 300 it. This making see different light. So reddit, AITA? TLDR; I girlfriend fake 300 dollar perfume wanted. Apparently automatically tell fake made look really materialistic ungrateful.

However whatever reason, made Michael nickname everyone calls that. Her name Michael. When I met her, I found kinda cute everyone called that. Now annoying. Hardy anyone calls wife name.

Also I never heard whatever actress talking cause I go looking women named Michael! I \[33M\] recently purchased run high-end bar. I venue maintain certain standard image therefore require staff wear professional work attire uniform. As professional attire fields, includes female staff wearing makeup. This image bar I guests experience. I see issues this, I worked hospitality I early 20's, female staff always required wear makeup, dramas. I clearly communicate acceptable uniform staff style guide I provide every months. "Lisa" \[22F\] decided studied woman's course uni now 'woke' us made issue requiring female staff wear makeup guys. This quite laughable obviously guys wear makeup professional uniform. Lisa Friday night refused wear makeup shift, I send home busy Friday night. She fair I strict emphasis female uniform male uniform lot less effort – 'discriminatory'. She also I girls spend hour full face makeup I can pay girls extra hour products. I laughed face uniform differ professional attire industry standard woman wear makeup professional environments. Furthermore, I owner/manager can choose attire staff wear bar's look I want.

She slept stepson's room, stepson still asleep (he normally sleeps late weekends). When I first came downstairs, crying phone. I proceeded introduce ask I help anything. She phone mother, taking care son staying stepson. I proceeded ask knew stepson job, met online (Bumble). We talked little bit further, and, due reasons I will explain, I ultimately prioritizing dating (especially men stepson) instead focus career spending son (she single mother). Here's thing. My stepson living wife I since graduated high school ago. He handsome, tall, in-shape (due full-time work swimming instructor lifeguard). Since graduated, brought numerous women house (at least 20, I lost count now always aware due working sporadic hours). At first, wife I surprised meeting them. He barely enough date, uses free room playing video games. When confronted it, uses online dating set dates either brings house drives them. Last year, two pregnancy scares (which handled himself, wife I aware). Furthermore, months ago, I noticed kept bringing back two different women house alternation. Although I've always monogamous, long-term relationship type guy, I understand whole gist young men "sowing wild oats." My wife seem mind much long safe consensual. However, I feel stepson may completely transparent dates, I certainly believe currently good candidate young, single mothers. Am I wrong interjecting diverting young, single mother away current situation stepson? I believe son will greatly benefit taking break dating spending him. **EDIT:** To clarify, I will admit I protective urge comes single mothers. My wife number abusive partners past therapy ever since. While I'm saying stepson abusive, I believe "hookup" culture engaging healthy young, single mother whole future ahead her. Career children come first, opinion.Sock account. Need opinion fo solve issues going family. So my, (26f) husband (30m) fun trolling people getting skin online WhatsApp he’s never rude person cyber world. It’s personality. We cousin chat cousin, samuel (30m) always sensitive husbands antics. He directly tell husband doesn’t appreciate making fun beliefs, politics, appearance laughs husband continued Samuel eventually took remained quiet. We peace husband continued make jokes Samuel ignored. My husband made another joke Samuel samuels wife, Alia (25f) stepped saying didn’t appreciate us using husband punching bag everyone chat rude stopping husband. Alia always hothead, someone offends somebody else, always steps attacks. She’s doesn’t let people fight battles it’s annoying. So cousins I made private chat talking Samuel sensitive Alia shouldn’t crazy. Somehow Alia found messaged me. Here part messages I peoples opinions. Alia: husband rude worse. You always post messages fb saying “you nothing nice say, don’t say it” “be kind” “love first” husband directly say husband offending us. You say it’s personality. Me: personality. It’s fault don’t understand everyone’s relationship. Everyone along came. Alia: talking about? My husband always disliked husband. Me: well didn’t say anything year, means he’s okay it. It’s you. Alia: true okay, let’s say it’s me. I’m offended husband. You think it’s personality right? I’m saying it’s hurtful. You private messaged apologized least asked I okay, If cared peace kindess much. Me: I nothing apologize for. My husband I didn’t anything wrong. You don’t understand dynamics always try pick fight. It went bit Alia eventually let go. So Reddit, think? Should I reached apologized husband behavior? My family saying Alia crazy Samuel overly sensitive. Edit: Alia doesn’t politely say stop. She throws disrespectful insults well. Edit: okay, person defending me, I guess I wrong I’ll reach apologize. Edit: I thought I wasn’t saying anything fine. My cousins later 30/ I nothing wrong. I guess I’ll show Reddit too.

My youngest daughter clearly prefers husband, given oldest daughter, best friends: everything together, things, often bond games, music, anime. I've tried bond deeply daughter, I understand tastes, alone hardly ever anything talk about. My husband see problem, often says *"each parent daughter"*, seem right me. I recently decided build garden asked daughter help me, I often bonded sister gardening. She right away, I forced anyway. I thought beautiful afternoon, laughing chatting, wasn't. She complained ALL time, dirt gross, sun gonna burn every I turned around, I saw using phone. At point I bored attitude *"if dislike much, go leave mother alone."* She went back house.

And sweet me, gave green light. Well recently I needed work they’d be, “paying us back”. But never apart plan. She says spent own. And people don’t handouts life. I don’t understand position. And I’m going ask sister pay back. She also suggested mother pitch pay us back. When I stupid, since wasn’t moms wedding. And asked sister. She I’m a, “mommas boy, needs priorities straight”.

Val known troubled mentally, & particularly sensitive certain sounds & smells (apparently traumatic death mother younger never heard story details). Anyway, gathering, Mel mentioned created vlog whole birth process (everything SFW lady bits captured), & wanted everyone watch (the ladies interested since first couple kid). I saw Val visibly uncomfortable pushing part, & excused herself. I asked wrong, comfortable sounds. I thought ridiculous, since part birthing process & joking 'well go anyway now's chance prep yourself'. She excused anyway, & curt I asked sensitivities. James overheard & back off, I found later Val gets anxious around smell specific type disinfectant I happen use & sounds pain reminded mother's death (apparently still traumatic her). I asked James & Val (privately course) even come gathering first place & say hi baby, subjected childbirth vlog. I maybe good opportunity replace memories something positive, left calling insensitive. I rest group, thought I making big deal nothing. But family agrees Val rude face hospitality & put aside discomfort celebrate rest us.My grandma (70f) recently picked common acronyms slang now uses 24/7.

I going try fix I done wrong, i’ll offer option switch back schools (although I understand might late) I will drastically ease restrictions set place. Furthermore, I going sit apologize, I cared I wrong. Forgive mistakes, I’m long lurker made account specifically ask issue. I (47m) stepson (16m) purposes post, we’ll call “T”. I’ve married wife (48F) two years two daughters (7F & 9F) ex. Since day T moved house nothing disrespectful. I understand change, especially change drastic (moving, getting new siblings/ new parent) hard kid stuff crosses line. For example, I transferred really great private high school moved I wanted best opportunities. He always complains doesn’t new classmates, school far away (it’s 15 minutes old school, practically nothing) doesn’t environment. He doesn’t understand later will thank this, I killed opportunity age! Additionally, always breaks rules set place. I asked surrender phone living room 9pm family says wants talk old friends. He constantly claims food mother I make even hasn’t tried it. His mother I try date night twice week always claims busy watch step sisters. We asked repeatedly passwords social media accounts refuses hand over… etc. I’m sick disrespect house, I set boundaries. Either starts treating respect listening me, can find somewhere else live. Obviously I wouldn’t really kick out, I’m hoping scares sense him. My wife, however, I took far need apologize tell I wasn’t serious. I feel will undermine authority though. AITA? Edit: I clarify things seem causing confusion comments. He change schools sixteen. We change 14, moved house, halfway first high school. Also, change, talked beforehand. He wasn’t excited changing schools.[deleted]So I've dating girl little year. I'll call E.

Don't matters. Recently father passed away. He really leave money partially paid condo I desperately wanted live in. nothing fancy. Just small 650 square foot 2 bedroom place. It's cozy. I've struggling homelessness since husband I split. Rents drastically increased, I'm talking doubled since I last. I afford anything. The cheapest 1 bedrooms 1800 month. Bachelor's around 1500. After taxes I make 2000. I assume dad's mortgage right around $600 every month. I asked sister, pled case take well. She's hurting money. Owns multiple properties world. I even can make anything happen still half. I'd half go son also reason I move somewhere cheaper. My ex husband visit outside place whenever I want. If I place suitable bedroom son splitting custody 50/50. Anyways, sister husband sent barrage angry texts calling greedy asshole. Curious reddit opinion. Please gentle.[removed]Throwaway obvious reasons. My friend (27M) married wife (27F) 3 years ago. Unfortunately, neither talked finances marriage neither pre-nup. He makes $70k, makes $55k. However, bought 15 Bitcoin 2013 pretty good price. He sold 5 2017 help buy house wife (then fiancee). Fast forward now, divorcing found job 20% raise guaranteed promotion within 2 years, several states away (All three us live town Missouri, job wife wants Seattle) quit job leave parents, 60's mom Stage 2 cancer. Now initially, wife Bitcoin, friend people. But must her, since wants half now even though buy (yes I community property is). His argument since bought marriage never mixed remaining 10 martial assets claim refusing split it. One day, invited (25M matters) lunch basically plan "that bitch steals nothing". His plan involves spending good chunk vacation new car. Totally legit I see nothing wrong that. He also wants put towards mother's medical bills. I think also fine, chemo expensive. But gray part wants give part remaining bitcoin cash-out divorce final, I give back 95% keep last 5% token thanks. The split 20 - 30 - 50, respectively. I realized basically spending half vacation, car medical bills giving wife's "half" it. He sent Bitcoins last night I put newly-made portfolio. But girlfriend (22F) saw brokerage app asked I explained situation holding onto Bitcoins friend. She replied sounds illegal (She law student) also asshole thing called asshole spoken nearly day. Now guilt girlfriend I feel conflicted. AITA?I 3 daughters (17, 16, 13). My middle daughter smart I call business mind. When 11, started babysitting neighbor’s grandkids free liked watching them. Then realized make money it. When 13 made nextdoor account posted ad babysitting. She posts ads frequently responds every post sees someone needing babysitter town. Then 14, started expanding neighboring towns. Her business exploded pandemic. She high demand able charge $25 hour 15. She eventually many clients hired older sister friends babysit people. She even everyone “hired” sign “contract” saying gets 20% money jobs gets them, except tips, keep. I always problem responding every post leaving jobs people, stayed quiet parents choice hire her. I never supported taking part sisters friends wages though, husband fully supports it. My oldest daughter saving buy car middle daughter went “her share” wages. I didn’t let middle daughter take oldest’s money she’s threatening “fire” oldest. My husband says oldest knew getting signed contract still doesn’t make right opinion. AITA letting middle daughter take oldest’s wages Edit: I saw comments regarding babysitting business real company. She pays taxes liability insurance case anything happens. My husband CPA helps side business. I don’t think contracts legally binding yet she’s working making bindingHello Reddit hope everyone’s nice day! So happened hours ago. I (18f) cat Pearl (who’s boy name miss leading) he’s old cat, aunt found new born I 5 6, means Pearl around 13-12 years old. In rest months Pearl lost lot weight point can see spin looking Now I jumped eating soft food, drinking clean water pooping still along happy always. Do COVID mom can’t afford take Pearl vet even discount expensive. But we’ve looking getting milk give unweight kittens see works. Anyways I friend Sam (19f) college come work project. At first working Pearl jumped coffee table looking rubs. Sam freaked saw him. So I explained everything can’t afford vet, fact he’s still eating he’s pain. But didn’t listen started screaming family horrible letting suffer, pets taken away this. My family owns another cat Opal dog Evelyn they’re important Sam continued scream we’re abusing animals locked up. That’s mom came asked screaming. My friend stared screaming mom wasn’t kicked Sam out. But tried run door Pearl thankfully I able pick that. Now I’m siting worried might actually animals taken away, claiming abuse. So Reddit Am I Asshole Edit: I’m sorry I confused anyone weight loss wasn’t sudden happen period Update 1: After research I found 24 hour emergency vet little hour train I’m going now, I’ll update everyone morning happens. Update 2: Okay I’m extremely tired I’ll try explain everything. So I arrived vet hospital around 10 pm ish I’ll say, kind packed I’ll say half waiting room filled. But wanna I went check I quickly fire foster house? I don’t remember house full animals supposed adopted out. Well house full old sick cats, many injured. I hours wait wasn’t big hospital. So I sat waited I think three hours passed calling people again. Anyways I getting tired Pearl stressed lights dogs. And I might shot I left Pearl, sadly I left 1 morning. Instead going home I walked aunts apartment gets home late job. As way avoid stressing Pearl long ride home I dropped her. Don’t worry aunt owns cat named Grey sweet boy Pearl along. I sounds stupid Pearl screaming little lungs hours I didn’t stress more. I stayed aunt hours make sure Pearl comfortable leaving. I didn’t chance pick back I home, I leave college. But I done school I picked up, brought home. Finally I sat mom called every single place getting quotes checkup cost along cost bloodwork dental. My mom found great place checkups $75, bloodwork $220 dental don’t cost I set appointment Monday 12. Sorry it’s jumbled I really need sleep everyone’s advice Update 3: The vet called I reset Thursday 4. Final update here: https://www.reddit.com/user/story_writer2/comments/rihif4/update_on_pearls_condition/This throwaway account obvious reasons. Yesterday, daughter (25F) (45F) therapist diagnosed ADHD. I struggling mental health taking antidepressants MDD. I also point kind rough childhood, I won’t go much detail about, I wasn’t always best mom teenager, I try best brother father I went nasty divorce I became single mom. I everything I them, working three jobs feed clothe left little much else. (Side note: I’ve dealt lot issues since then, decade ago. I become much different person, daughter even multiple times much better mother I now I’m dealing that.) I immediately I disagreed diagnosis offended. I I don’t really believe quantitative testing ADHD, I worked child development center 11 years life good idea kind thing looks like. She I really haven’t lived since teenager (because I mentioned before. I obviously physically lived her), I nothing general living habits adult life it’s affecting day-to-day basis. She become crippling, even realized things can trace back childhood; mentioned procrastination, careless mistakes, getting easily distracted among them, I’m pretty sure common school-age kids. I everyone quirks issues, that’s part life everyone struggles deal differently. She cried saying felt I invalidating experiences AVe diagnosis I unsupportive even though I trying realistic (she’s always somewhat flair dramatic). So Reddit, AITA? Edit 1: I kind degree psychology, I hold sociology degree. Just fact know. Edit 2: The reason I mentioned degree someone asked education comments, I’m trying suggest I’m professional.[removed]Hi, I friend fired job 9 months ago keeping gift card remaining balance customer left, essentially theft since used week later caught. I don’t really details I honest since I didn’t work her. I found another reliable friend work her. Anyways, fast forward, I hired restaurant week interestingly enough, friend fired also works now employed 4 months already. I don’t think managers fired last job. Will I asshole tell them?I started new job last month. At previous employer, lax laid back. They work sponsored beer Fridays end every week, served beer work cafeteria, limit per person work day. That said, I usually drank Busch Light IPA every day lunch past 2.5 years. &nbsp; During interview process new job, asked I liked [then] current employer, I mentioned lax interviewer "Not brag, known lax culture well. I bet laid back current employer". This relief hear. I'll skip past boring parts, interviews place, I offer took job. &nbsp; Upon accepting position, I mailed onboarding packet employee handbook. I read handbook front back see anything alcohol policy book. This along mention "very lax work culture" thinking many things change culture standpoint old job new one. &nbsp; The first weeks lot training training usually ran lunch, provide us variety sandwich options/pizza catered, well drink options (waters, sodas, juice, tea, coffee, etc.) I help whatever provided. Later month, boss scheduled lunch restaurant vendor introduce explain new role, lunch boss first person order beer, rest us followed suit. This another good sign. &nbsp; Fast forward last week, training I starting settle routine working day day tasks. That said, I packed lunch, included lunch Busch Light. I ate first lunches desk, undisturbed anyone else. I think anything it. Eventually I invited eat lunch lunchroom upstairs, I joined colleagues upstairs lunch. I unpacked lunch cracked open Busch Light. Immediately I sense "What hell guy thinking" vibe colleagues, anything. I brushed off. Later day HR stopped along boss called HR office. They I unacceptable "I'm lucky I'm getting fired type behavior." I mentioned vendor lunch boss shot daggers. We ended meeting agreement I refrain drinking alcohol job again. &nbsp; The next day, boss chewed "throwing bus" asked "what hell I thinking". I big deal, grown adult gets drunk even buzzed single beer lunch. I following lead thought acceptable! So much "lax".I'm 23, mother (obviously). Throwaway anonymity. To preface, I'm exclusively breastfeeding child, 6mo old. Father picture. My sister, call Cindy, 26. She married course I invited. It really nice ceremony, I front row. I brought extra bottle I think ceremony long. Just walked aisle altar, son started loudly cry. I thought hungry I started breastfeed him. It quieted I thought well. Figured big deal better alternative crying. However, wedding filmed videographer, I'm plain view. My sister immediately ceremony pissed saw it. (I assured I'm probably video, I am.) She matter I'm video not, trashy either way. She I ruined special day. She asked leave instead joining reception. My mother says I apologize admit I wrong. She also says I buy something else registry purchased make amends. My mother also says I excused child restroom. I dont think issue I'm natural. She knows I child, knows I breastfeed. Children explicitly allowed, I even verified asking I bring baby son. So, I asshole? I'm sure do. This 2 weeks ago I spoken sister all.I (23M) dating girlfriend, Jane (21F) nearly year. We go separate colleges 40 minutes away another, still see multiple times week. I've noticed though always prefers come apartment small town rather visiting apartment. When talk family, always reserved tells close hers. As far friends go, I've met great deal highschool college friends seem average. Now, always presented "broke college student" will actively say fact whenever money comes laughs off. However, I've noticed months despite saying that, refuses eat fast food, likes going impromptu "mini vacations" standard staying within country means cheap, drives car worth $70k. Last night met "childhood friends" shoot pool. A noticed I drive Tesla I bought brand new year. It's pride joy, I will admit I've done quite well building income. Here's red flags start. They called different name. Rather name I friends I've met call by, calling something else completely. All friends also foreign, coming Brazil, Spain, Ivory Coast, etc. Eventually talking car, Brazilian girl named Camilla asked Jane intended ask father buy one. Jane shrugged awkwardly "maybe". Throughout night became glaringly obvious "childhood friends" came extremely wealthy families, I asked Jane met them. She went school together overseas went summer camps together. Jane also spoke languages English, mostly French Spanish seemed besides English. After left back place, I asked deal was, come well family, name friends called actual name. She went common came state easier people pronounce. I felt miffed lying source income seems years, actually lot money let on. I asked I look Venmo I see regular deposits father ranging $400-$1000 weekly "allowance". I called trustfund baby, liar pretending actually money clearly does, masquerading around lower classes likes looking live. She extremely upset left, still refusing speak me. AITA?Am I asshole straightening daughters hair without wife’s permission? I (male 32) four old daughter. Let’s call Gracie. Gracie half black, mother (female 31) African American. Her mother handled Gracie’s hair care taught simple styles even “simple” styles difficult. My wife ended going vacation friends celebrate friends birthday mother came visit. I hadn’t done Gracie’s days became nappy unmanageable. When I tried comb hair comb broke. My mother I daughter perm hair manageable I took salon permed. My wife home saw daughter livid. She screamed mother even suggesting I think she’s overreacting it’s hair. Then brought wedding. My mother tried wife straighten hair wedding wife refused wanted natural hair wedding day natural possible. My mother often comments wife’s daughters hair I agree mother. But now wife’s telling perms chemically burn damage hair change texture I “damaged” daughters hair. Now she’s thinking getting daughters hair cut hair can “heal damages” I still think she’s overreacting. Besides, I don’t daughters hair cut. She looks cute now. Am I asshole straightening daughters hair without wife’s permission even though Gracie daughter too? Edit: I’ve read comments came realization marriage wife now I feel horrible. My wife’s mentioned passing childhood always vague overhearing conversation mother law I realized much I truly messed up. My wife dark skinned tall bullied along hair. She went predominately white school bogalusa made hate looks while. My god wording horrible too. My wife beautiful daughter hair isn’t problem. I’m problem mother. After hearing wife’s conversations mother I realized mothers bully I’m drone/follower. My mother constantly picked wife I stood blindly agreed she’s mom. But woman I married wife I protected from… ignorance mothers ignorance. I took something took pride belittled it. I lazy learn took mothers advice. Hell mothers many cruel things I didn’t think twice reading comments. She’d always make sure daughter didn’t play outside she’d go house didn’t darker mother comment made uncomfortable I took weird joke. I’m cutting mother I’m going apologize wife daughter start watching hair tutorials again. I’m also going sign hair braiding class pandemic slowed more. God I’m horrible husband father. When wife willing talk (I won’t force her) I’ll apologize wants leave it’ll hurt hell I’ll understand. I’ve pushed sidelines long couldn’t even see it. I asshole. The biggest asshole here. Edit 2: I phone mother. My wife listened phone call, I didn’t realize living room put hand shoulder call. My mother well, livid. She freaked threatened call CPS When I I didn’t coming around wife daughter refused even try understand wrong. Then I mentioned damage perm cause daughter, (I read small article black owned hair care company childhood perm horror stories along history behind perms I’m just… disgusted mother) mother wife drama queen. When I daughter might need hair cut behind flipped “I won’t let grand daughter look bull d*ke!” And I mortified. She she’s take daughter wife raise way god intended. That caused screaming match. My wife put hand shoulder midst took phone home mother comes home police will called hung up. I put baby bed talked. My daughter wife beautiful I don’t understand life I thought horrible things. Maybe snl sketch “diet racism.” Hearing things parent blindly listening matter horrible sounds. My wife still mad (rightfully so) isn’t leaving this. She I lot learn I relationship last I need open eyes realize world I live different lives different world daughter will live in. Im horrified horrified mother. My father called moments ago I ignored call. I’ll talk morning this. Thank talking sense I thanked wife staying even though doesn’t to. Tomorrow asking baby girl wants hair cut. Knowing she’ll uncle. He cool designs shaved hide head. If wants can that. She’s world I refuse ever ignorant harmful again. Final edit: wife I arranged daughter spend night mother laws house couples therapy will near future. The comments sections certainly given many perspectives horrible words actions are. I won’t replies edits throw away account. I think that’s right term this. My mother called house multiple times sisters phone. My sister 25 lives drama now whole family mothers side blowing phone many mixed opinions… horrible. It’s funny, family member who’s opinion reflects comment sections common consensus disowned months ago. Well actually that’s funny. It shows messed family is. Thank reply’s matter “harsh” “mean” might seem, I needed this.When husband I first started talking kids I firm I daughters I didn’t gymnastics ballet. I history eating disorders I don’t put daughters sports high incidence that. I ballet 10 years damage psych irreversible. Also husband I tall sports favour petite girls.

I kinda went later night although sees point, supports me, bit kind unfair daughter won’t really understand I’m letting ballet. This literally first anything negative aversion gymnastics ballet I bit taken aback. AITA here? Edit: LMAO The misogyny comments saying I'm projecting insecurities daughter. If helps, I also firm rule allowing son play tackle football. Am I projecting personal insecurities onto well???? This protecting insecurities lol.[deleted]I perfect father, goddamn. The way daughter (Alana, 26) talks therapy, think I'd never done anything good all. I it. I fucked up. But I therapist asked daughter's words made feel: "I'm trying shift blame, wife right daughter bad word entire time. Is goijg family therapy bash Dad hour forty-five minutes every week?" He that, uncomfortable feeling I felt frustration daughter feeling years. And I him, "I that, I'm here, can past move forward. Forward. Not continuously going back past talking things change.

I wife go sessions without now can listen daughter complain obviously hates much, better I stay away. My wife I stopped going make AH support daughter healing process. I easy say getting targeted every week (too) *family* therapy I remove I'm cause problems. I'm doubts though I neglect daughter lot little, I better relationship her, I keep going this? Fuck no.[removed]This happened couple months ago, I aware issue recently I called asked bring anything Christmas invited. I'm going call fiancé's mom Madeline partner Robert. So Madeline I really difficult relationship. I open fixing it, I MILs DILs hard sometimes, right now tense. Also social circle weddings huge deal. I thing everywhere, around typical bride wear white pre-wedding festivities honestly little extra. Madeline also likes needle people. I heard saying love Robert ass back her. She ahs also implied finds boring, I whole sarcasm pissing people fun. My parents hosted nice engagement party us Madeline showed little late. My mom gave obligatory compliment dress, Robert turned me, smirked, I thank Madeline white cocktail dress planned wearing, spilled champagne boat months ago realize stained.

Madeline fiancé really talk anymore, always spend Christmas eve her. I texted days ago asked bring anything I invited I kicked party joke even make. I really put aside Christmas see son? She wrote back lol no. I feel really overreacting mentally abusive keeping family.So backstory, I school care provider small, somewhat underprivileged elementary school south. I issues students, call Nash. Nash persistently acts out, recently directing behavior personally. For context, I heavier side, also female, struggle body image issues. Every day school I give kids snack Nash always nasty remark prepared. He take snack say something "Ms. Nasty Quibbits FAT snacks", another remark relating appearance. It seriously affected mentally emotionally point I dreaded going work I dreaded snack even more. Flash forward days ago I approached superior wanted talk Nash's behavior school. The gist conversation school making budget cuts, need cut portion kids using school-subsidized care program. Nash kids, supervisor basically wanted I felt cutting disruption point bothering children. I inquired asking (it seemed odd give special attention, cut him?) Nash's father recently sentenced lengthy prison stay mother begged cut. After thinking moment I yes, retrospect behavior children generally much issue, however I decided making uncomfortable point hindering job performance putting children risk. &#x200B; When I mother though insisted I abandoned child behaving callously towards child need. I tried explain affecting job performance (she KNOWS I feel weight), I children disservice I best, slammed door face I sort child abuser. Personally I think personal lives children concern, responsibility bring attitude school grounds. &#x200B; &#x200B; EDIT: For asking Nash 7.My wife I great relationship. Very open communication willingness help other. This unique situation we’re bit frustrated. My wife stays home take care beautiful, baby son. I work 45-50 hour weeks need 6:30 AM. I also diagnosed genetic health condition kind scary leaves fatigued people. I struggle fatiguing events, losing lots sleep. So I wake night care crying baby, makes work days especially difficult. However, I love wife make sure take care child weekend nights. I choose sleep care baby wife can extra sleep. This also applies days I off, holidays. I don’t feel 2/7 + days structure unfair I need early alert work. I understand needs awake tend baby, can also take naps baby does. I privilege. I also help take care baby night good father would. I can’t waking middle night I work. AITA?My fiance (26F) I (28M) getting married destination wedding next summer. The destination special fiance vacationed family couple times younger holds sentimental value her.

Of course, downfall destination wedding people might able attend. We expected lot conversations making sure take anything personally people attend clear people asked wedding party cost expectations. There couple friends I asked groomsmen decline due young kids I totally respect it. I'm idiot, wedding important kids you. This much problem fiance's side family comes money destination weddings kind norm them. In dated I think 4-5 cousins destination weddings, attended fuss anyone's part ones go to. My family however, come money. When I parents siblings wedding plans, kind freaked able afford it. I it, siblings kids expenses too. I I understand something able afford I I love there, I hold make work. My parents guilted little bit, assured will attending. However, pool money together (and "all" mean mostly me) make sure siblings families can attend. I pretty much way I can that. My 2 sisters wind idea (probably mom) way can attend I help pay least half trips whole families, kids included. I kind laughed way I will that. They since I decided destination wedding responsibility make sure family can attend. I I love love wedding, I funding vacations entire family. I way I even consider spouses, kids. They excluding kids acceptable. They I turned stuck-up asshole since I engaged I rubbing fiance's money faces. They accused destination wedding purpose rub faces afford something it. &#x200B; EDIT: It suggested I add comment I made post. &#x200B; >it hurts watch choose money participation life; hurts excluded wedding close loved one. Meh, really show much interest life anyway. Shit, sisters face-timed complain, first either taken call almost 18-months. I 10-years younger older sister 8-years younger other. I afterthought lives ever since started kids. I hold them, I it. Their families important things lives. I make sure send cards kids every birthday, gifts every kid Xmas. I even text birthday. Maybe right. Maybe I'm kidding thinking I actually subconscious reminding DGAF unless think can something it. But act actually care important life events kind makes laugh now I think it.So I (29F) I born family lot money.

First context: I hosting thanksgiving house. We push date back day convenience people. I two kids, 12M 15F. Earlier today came asking get-together doing. I started listing people, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends family, etc. I 2 friends, privacy's sake I'll call John David, faces dropped. I stopped asked wrong oldest explained comfortable around John David. I asked give straight answer. These guys two best friends since kindergarden 2nd grade respectively I've always included celebrations appropriate. David even attended kids' birthdays nice gifts. I've always around kids anything extremely kind them. My kids ask I exclude John David get-together, I'd already invited them. It rude un-invite them, I going tell them? Because kids asked? They might believe It hurt feelings. I asked asked tell feel way I never actual answer. I consulted wife matter sympathized also reason kids feel way. For right now I decided keep invited, I see reason kids uncomfortable around them. I kids can tell happen, I will un-invite John David. They seemed quite upset hours passed currently bed, still explanation given. If need information I'll happy give I can. Am I Asshole? Edit: I will talking children morning this. If still say anything, I'll exclude John David together. Edit 2: For context: There almost situation kids unsupervised. They live multiple hours away come occasions this, I never alone kids times. My kids old enough go yet school security let random dudes much less let alone kids. I've tried make clear possible kids can tell anything Edit 3: I understand sentiment here. I trusting kids initially really bad move part. I think abuse occured, unfortunetly I slim possibility. Edit 4: I understand something going I going take advice try bottom this. I really appreciate mention sexual abuse. I fact going on. I sounds I bet true, I truth. I've known John David almost life neither ever anything that. Final edit: My kids getting minutes. I'm going calm talk wife. I'm absolutely letting John David near kids being, I absolutely clear. I also patience argue nearly 600 you, I clear things up. I'm almost certain sexual abuse occured. I say 2 get-togethers kids John / David present, events outside. We open flat backyard can sneak together. As two events held inside, birthdays kids. I obviously focused whole time, I nothing happened then. As times outside events, John David live hours away us way house access kids around. Their school security neither old enough alone without us. As social media, I'm certain nothing going on. As far I daughter (the phone) snapchat, John David have. As far I know, facebook, daughter doesn't. I sure I likely go phones. John David also wives, kids, jobs own. I understand everyone's concerns I will probably making update post hours. Our get-together starts 8:30 last 12. Might take longer update depending things go people stick around longer. I hear I putting kids first this.

My boyfriend didn’t mind all, he’d enjoyed looking dog spend family, mum afternoon, eventually telling boyfriend I clearly unreliable I treated servant I dog needed feeding.

I need office job needs real bedroom going decided younger son share room older SIL will younger son's room. My older son always objected old "room" perfectly fine fair share room spoil SIL. I handle sharing room, welcome sleep office good enough SIL, good enough him. He speaking harassing SIL since. He parents also case prioritizing SIL sons I wanted I asshole.[removed]We live building soundproof. Her cat screams half hour soon goes bed. I mean full screaming. And keeps night anything it. I knocked door soon started happening last night, rudely asked, "It's 2 AM. Is emergency?" I needs stop letting cat scream late night, went cat separation anxiety doors closed, needs keep door closed else cat will chew cables screw deposit. I gave million solutions that, gave excuses saying work "tried them." I needs sleep couch house somewhere. She said, "This apartment living. Sometimes hear neighbors. Get it." I threatened call police make noise complaint, call I go back place. This morning, I heard call son saying "some white man" threatened arrested "meowing cat" twisted make sound I wanted put old black woman jail. AITA? She's days already causing trouble.I date Annie (22f) 4 months. It great relationship, I felt one, I started notice things reminded toxic ex I broke off. I'm also 29 age gap thing, ya know. I needed someone mature. I started seeing Jennette 3 months going 6 months strong. Annie I reached wish happy birthday. Annie also knows sister law job. My SIL let mom died I romantic feelings anymore, I care Annie, I I'd go pay respects sister law brother. I Jennette seemed funny idea. first reconsider talking sweet thing give Annie wrong idea (like I still her) I invited Jennette me. whole thing was...awkward. painfully awkward regrettable. assured I ready knew Annie still immature.

AITA?So literally title says. My bio mom wants (21M) little stepsister (15F) help around house more. While chores, I’m also college student responsibilities. I’m networking building future career. If needed I help out, mom says good character building stepsister. All come clean/vacuum room twice week take care laundry me. If completes chores Friday can hang freinds. This pretty minor since I’m clean guy, I talking gf arrangement taken aback thought I asshole letting chores me. I yeah I mom insists stepdad fine it. And I think it’s probably good thing learn responsibility helping around house. She dishes cleaning parts house top this, it’s nothing major reallly. AITA Edit 1: I explained better. Both mom stepdad think housework. Part reasoning isn’t cleaning room might end different chore even consuming, it’s kind win win. Edit 2: I’m debating weather ask stop room letting mom assign another part house—such garage—or giving reward week helping it’s win win. I thinking every 2 weeks gives shopping list I’ll buy something ~$100? What thoughts this? What best thing do? Edit 3: Because she’s cleaning room, she’ll given chores, I think alternative way help her. My plan hid dollar bills laundry it’s reward her, take shopping now treat Thankyou show I’m side. I will also help homework advice. How sound guys? Any better ideas? This sounds best win win Edit 4: chores bc bad behavior passed thus given bigger workload foreseeable future. If there’s improvement Christmas I think workload will decrease I will advocate conversation happens Edit 5: Some people pointed parents harsh style harm good. In light Im going try talk to, Im going tell can always chill room ask favors me. Im going try step good figure can trust in. Thankyou practical advice. I’m going talk tonight I’ll let guys goes UPDATE!!!: I talked step sister morning situation. She it’s nice following: I keep room pretty clean takes ~15 minutes, mom thinks takes 1.5 hours plus. She also laundry isn’t bad load hers, real commitment folding it. The alternative cleaning room likely cleaning garage take much time. She prefers cleaning room garage. I I emphasize situation help out. From now on, I’m going give money week spend freinds. Then, every now I will take freinds movies, fairs, dinner, I will cover tabs. She extremely excited gave big hug texted freinds I think she’s happy! I figured taking treat, turning threat punishment—no seeing freinds—into reward good way subvert mom.

When package arrived, I happened two friends mine over, I knew judgemental I excited open package I watching. At first, seemed basic stuff send, I saw pieces paper folded I opened them, sexy photos taken me. I tried hide photos friends I realised late already seen them. Last night, I received call girlfriend mad shouting me. I asked wrong friends drunkenly mentioned seeing photos her. She embarrassed took photos thought I'd see I'd broken trust opening gift front friends. I tell anything sort I'd probably stuck photos wall anyway friends seen way. She started crying rejected efforts comfort hung me. Today I texted her, seem chirpy flirty usually I feel bad. I'm trying best fix things I'm also still confused mad I even photos. I understand I gone wrong make sense context situation. Am I asshole? “Katie” I friends 5 years. Being chronically ill, often flaked plans sickness bad. I always understanding that, wasn’t flake. She also flake oftentimes anxiety much didn’t feel anymore. All last minute. If flakes group things, I break news didn’t bother tell anyone else. I always tried understanding since something always going Katie I didn’t pile onto existing stress. But eventually enough enough I tried talk I felt. It didn’t go well, even though I tried calm private. She blew pressing issues worry missing bunch stupid togethers I plan wouldn’t hear I decided say something 5 years understanding. That back. Present day, I call someone says Katie put job reference (we met old job used other). I didn’t exactly take high road since I still hurt I also didn’t lie sabotage.

Anyways, people countries American continent (however US) we’re Americans live continent. A common word describe USA Americans USians.

I come super religious Christian family I don’t think parents expected I woman. They knew I liberal LGBT ally, I ever dated men. When I I marrying woman (via text) reaction wasn’t exactly positive also wasn’t negative. My mom replied “Oh, you’re getting married?” And dad “Oh ok.” Despite differences opinions, mom agree help plan wedding dad agreed walk aisle. My mom went dress shopping didn’t offer opinions. She agreed ever I liked (flowers, cake, dress, decorations, etc.) offered chip financially. She wasn’t rude anything, I tell times faking enthusiasm please me. The wedding best day life even though hurt grandparents refused attend religious reasons (I used close them). Fast forward now sister [24F] marrying fiancé [27M] April. Once us engaged, parents excited. I overheard mom offering opinions wedding details. It hurts disconnected wedding planning. My dad also cried sister talked wedding itinerary mentioned he’d walking aisle. When I asked walk aisle agreed, didn’t show much emotion besides small smile. I feel cheated yet I feel I don’t right feel way. My parents accepted despite beliefs I’m grateful nice wife, I feel I missed full wedding planning experience weren’t excited I marrying woman. It hurts much every dad talks hanging sisters’ fiancé emotional gets talks getting married huge milestone family. I feel parents proud think sister’s marriage aren’t proud mine. Recently I went wedding dress shopping sister I snapped dresses looked mom wouldn’t stop debating details dress style choices. My sister seemed upset I apologized her, I sarcastically mom “I don’t think interested wedding dress.” My mom upset started crying, saying really tried hard help wedding come every planning appointment offering pay make happy. I immediately felt horrible mom sister now tears bridal shop I’ve ruined wedding dress shopping experience sister. AITA?I (F25) recently married wonderful husband (M26). A little bit background, parents divorced I around 14. Shortly after, dad met remarried another woman call Brenda. With split custody good/close relationship parents, I spend half week mother’s house half father Brenda’s house. I 4 siblings, 3 boys sister I. My sister I always “daddies girls” I've recently realized now growing up, Brenda’s disdain towards sister I brothers probably stemmed jealousy. A examples, making little comments dad buy gifts us “they need that” “they’ll grow spoiled brats” etc...but never anything say dad buy things brothers. Would make comments weight appearance, generally seem annoyed anytime I tried talk her, went far making false assumptions father I sex may pregnant, little bit older, problem letting brothers use car always sister I, general mean woman reason. Fast forward couple years, I contact Brenda much, seen couple times i’d go visit dad remained ol’ mean Brenda I always knew. Well, recently wedding came around dad brought Brenda plus-one without knowledge. When I saw her, immediately I upset. While technically, kind family, I obviously wanted people I good terms good relationships wedding. So, I husband politely asked leave offered escort her. Now days I'm getting angry messages dad saying I “unacceptable” “Brenda’s feelings hurt, found I disheartening embarrassing” I find laughable honestly. The problem dad wants apologize says I welcomed home anymore unless I apologize. Even explaining I I dad accept answer. So AITA I apologize sake dad I’s relationship?I (35M) engaged wonderful woman well career. Everything going well me, news come worse time. I recently contacted "Carl" (16M) claims son toxic relationship ended 17 years ago. At first, I certain true. He offered DNA test, I agreed rid him. The unthinkable happened. It came back positive. Carl says ex horrible abusive basically entire life. He says never name anything use find me, I garbage man garbage son. Recently found name old leasing contracts ex I lived together. He figured things there. Carl says live ex anymore, safe there. He wants live family. I can't. I deal this. I contacted friend mine board really good boarding school. He pulled strings Carl admitted. I spoken Carl since. He writes tries call, I ignore him. He's reminder worst life. Everytime I look I feel sick stomach. I father. I can't. I feel bad him, I give wants. My fiance wants talk him, I keep refusing. It's putting serious strain relationship. I question choice every day, I think talking him, I realize selfish cruel, I'd giving hope relationship can never happen. Update: I've reading comments again. I spoke fiance past ex awful painful years were. She helped accept things happened me. Together, came decision. I wrote Carl email explaining, best ability, reaction I first learned son. I invited come visit spring break spend us. Just thinking seeing makes feel sick stomach, right thing do. It never plan provide Carl financially, comments made realize I left Carl great deal doubt uncertainty. I Carl will helping pay college two years (if wants go) course going covering expenses point. It never even occurred worried things, I considered it, knowing raised ex. I'm looking forward seeing him, I hope getting person will help separate ex mind. Maybe, time, can come sort relationship.My husband "Craig" (38M) I (33F) process adopting little girl "Catalina" (10F). We seeking adopt quite I children, known Catalina months.

My mom proceeded call TA tell I must care kids little girl I've never even met important them, I take probably go foster care. I actually met Catalina will see end next month, I obviously take kids circumstances. Mom listen proceeded tell kids "Aunt howtobeacat101 care you." Now I feel really bad worried I'm failing niblings I take present (if Catalina's I think handle I will absolutely). I really go back adoption. In country now, child really chance. But I wrong prioritizing right family? Side note: Cara wanted BIL raise kids something happened obviously honor that.I(32M) daughter "Emily"(12F) ex(29F). Ex daughter's life gave full custody born.

Emily grandmother feels giving Emma everything wants favoring Emma. Her grandparents called started yelling I good father Emily needed prove Emily I loved much Emma. Edit: Emma Emily choose room wanted. Emma us wanted bigger one. Emily felt let Emma pick room without discussing her. AITA letting step-daughter take bigger room?I've driver's license since I 16, back then, parents allowed use car using it. A years later I 18, parents new car traded old one.

This something adamantly interested doing, I'm assuming shocked/upset mother, I put foot solid no. &#x200B; Now saying I'm asshole I'll crushing mother's dreams I let tell Abram. &#x200B; Will I asshole I relent? &#x200B; Edit: I've much read/process responses, much less reply clarify: Lilly adopted - ethnicities different, etc. Our main reason tell Abram nothing him, I'm sure always going let eventually (especially biologically related me), wanted complicate relationship John give reason bullied etc. Mostly latter, main fear kids assume affair something that, due community live (reasonably conservative nosy).I (F55) two sons, 'Mike' (M32) 'Jack' (M24). Mike engaged Sarah, partner three years, Jack started dating then-classmate, 'Rose' (F24) eight years ago. I love Sarah sweet, easy-going woman I wait married son. However, I good opinion Rose. I'm almost sure son find someone 'better', I must heavy-heartedly admit good-looking intelligent Jack. She many male friends regularly going (and almost female ones). She goes flirty hubby, obviously loves talking (he says flirting easy talk with). Apparently, also neither wants married children big red flag. All all, suspicious I able along her. Mike also her, husband Jack says I'm dramatizing. In family tradition per decade go photographer special family session. It's special time, tradition followed husband's family generations. It happened last photo-session ten years ago, decided highest make new one. My husband suggested whould invite Rose Sarah (Mike's fiancee), opinion part family now. I I'm ok Sarah shoot (as Mike engaged daughter-in-law soon), I Rose relationship Jack serious enough event family-only. Jack visibly upset dating Rose longer Mike Sarah. I tried explain serious since marry called close-minded prejudiced. What hurt husband openly supported (which I sort expected adores Rose), also Mike, though relucnantly. I tried explain I us see photo Jack break I made situation worse. rJack went far tell I agree Rose photo, will I'm jealous her. Now husband Jack talk all. I mend relationship I still think I anything wrong I try protect boy getting hurt. Am I really The Asshole?I two kids - Alexia (16F) Ashton (9M). Alexia always collected Webkinz young. She easily 200 them. If website/game tied animals well digital copy every animal get. Despite older age Alexia still using digital site "play" toys. I think Alexia focus activities geared toward teenager I'm going stop playing Webkinz. I however think share toys brother wants play little boy wont do. Alexia however completely refuses share Webkinz Ashton I can buy own. It came head today Ashton wanting play dragon Alexia's literally ripped hand. He came crying I decided enough enough, I tired rivalry them. Since Alexia going budge rudeness, I Ashton dragon. To say Alexia pissed understatement. She I give dragon back paid (she's funding whole toy addiction now). I acknowledge paid living house fair brother hundreds toys plain sight play with. I say give him, share. This apparently still unreasonable. My husband firmly sides me, adding wants toy dragon, can buy Ashton asking share. I'm also sure matters since dragon Webkinz site even needs physical beyond me. I see compromise children happy, Alexia remains incensed. AITA?My son (14) slob. I’m tired cleaning room taking trash laundry. He’s school week. I left note Monday. He needs take trash. Make bed sheets comforter I washed. Do dishes. Hang clothes put underwear socks appropriate drawers. Put nerf guns ammo container purposed. Vacuum room. I wasn’t done I home today gets gets. (Two pairs jeans already wrapped) I’ve expensive gifts closet I can’t bring give him. (I grew living frugally) husband thinks I’m asshole everyone lots gifts Christmas. FYI, daughter 23 gets gifts need couple fun. Am I Asshole giving big gifts can’t even keep ones has? My husband adamant go shopping gifts tomorrow!I title sounds bad, allow explain. So sister lives South Africa boyfriend. We're UK reference. Recently, boyfriend bought house. This house huge, say least. It's 4 bedrooms, 3 bathroom, largest bedroom walk wardrobe. There's 2 bathrooms, well pool. Not mention two garages massive garden. Recently, sister talking house, bragging house. I make clear I'm happy sister boyfriend able buy house, however, property cheap South Africa, house £1,000,000 UK. While talking, I buying house big South Africa really buying house large UK, reasons listed above. She joking I need stop jealous, however, spoken since. According mother, sister thinks I jerk saying I did, mother agrees with. My mother thinks boyfriend earned money buy house, counts much buying house here. I'm aware I phrased things better, however, I still stand premise I said. AITA here? My Son wife live town they’re apparently issues home. And legitimately everyone seems share sentiment. I’m sure can attribute shortcomings to, “how I raised him”. She whines Facebook me, “not teaching son cook”….but….cooking reading recipes….anyone can it. It’s responsibility send world gourmet chef. She tells son was, “babied life”. But laundry reason can’t operate washer. If can’t handle something takes 2 minutes outside washing/drying that’s her. She’s welcome show how. But I’m going accept blame laundry home. She recently started complaining her, “MIL decided show precious little angel wrap presents”…..I mean, seriously? She frequents JNMIL. And posts basically blaming 2 able handle simple chores without complaining. It’s ironic, doesn’t really cook either usually takeout according son. Their lack “life skills” inability handle 100% mental/emotional/domestic labor relationship me. Yes, son watched it. But I didn’t force expect wife. And I’m certainly going apologize standing husband I guess forcing children see looks like. I responded tell none fault. And feels need place 100% blame someone. She look son, even honestly. If wasn’t busy whining might able show him. Since can’t handle herself. Now I’m a, “parent won’t accept responsibility parenting failures”. According Twitter is. **Edit 1**: I say fault. Although I strongly believe blaming expert present wrapper nonsense. **Edit 2**: For consistently claiming wants, “an equal partner”. You note she’s SAHW wants husband “just much housework myself”. They kids SAHM. But I understand. **Edit 3**: I’m CPA, housewife. I SAHM upon time. But I’m anymore. And I’ve seen son clean load laundry before. So I capable.UPDATE: Someone asked post update I thought I rather open new portal people spout vitriol me. My 84 yo Dad accident ended hospital I flew early see him/take care him. I'm sure spiteful people giddy glee. At time, Omicron threat looms appears likely partner will joining us expected fear go quarantine. Our home state 'opening up' Feb 5 I may stay rather spending 2 weeks quarantine, I I'm hoping can join last weeks. Tl;Dr - The 'get together' going likely without partner due external reasons. \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So partner I going home town Christmas (her family Japan). We spending 2 weeks, will spent family days us exploring ourselves. My high school friends make plans catch airbnb spend night playing games etc. I asked girlfriend minds I bring along, none friends bringing partners changes dynamic somewhat (English first language lot games play difficult her). I gave option stay family (whom met before) stay high school friend's gf (whom stayed will probably stay night again). She blew up, now saying coming trip anymore etc. etc. I offer instead fly hometown couple days earlier originally planned catch friends, I'll pick airport. This too, option apparently, maintains longer coming trip (which btw I paid half flight). AITA? Edit: This blew bit, I feel majority saying I'm asshole strong minority disagree, I'm glad clear cut. To address recurring themes: 1. She speak English, live Australia worked lived 5 years, I meant struggles understand new games general interest sort 'intellectual' game. 2. I happily put private AirBnB similar wanted, I offer I pretty sure either, discuss next I will make sure knows option available. 3. I mentioned comment thread I think part worried I there. She asked going 'get strippers' I feel knows ridiculous. Anyway plan another talk it, I will present 'solo accommodation' option well concede I guess I'll bring along, take mental note uncompromising can be.

Also, I'm quite sure trying impress attempting wear designer, high school anymore, almost 40s really age appropriate her... Anyways, I went thorough research, bought similar looking bag trusted website sells replicas designer bags HUNDREDS dollars cheaper, bag I bought $300, (the real bag $700) looked real deal. Unfortunately, The box bag came though cheap looking scratched up. So, I quickly search someone nearby selling real box, day searching, I finally found someone lived 3 hours away $150. I took day work working wonder I'm going. I spend total $80 gas driving back, gas super expensive I live... When I finally met person, price $250..

Some backstory needed, goes: My bother 'Mike' excellent chess player. When I say 'was', I mean forced give Dad. My Mother silently supported Dad, SAHM's era. My parents us way late life. Mike born parents 35, I 'accident' 43 years old. They 65 now, enjoying retirement. Mike loved chess began playing lot. He soon crushing older players, guys local chess club literally thought Chess Grand Master material provided right training exposure. They encouraged play tournaments much could, even U.S. Open Chess Championship held annually. Dad wanted Mike pro baseball player instead. He lost ton weight play Mike, best coaches, even flew Boston watch Sox. And made sure reminded Mike it. Mike, meanwhile, won bunch trophies playing chess hid room Dad existed. Dad eventually threw chessboard prized antique chess set too. From now baseball way - Mike sucked it. Years training, plenty money drain, many meet-ups retired players later, Dad finally realised dream be. He finally gave up, Mike relieved. A fraction money spent towards baseball definitely pushed brother top tier chess. I asked Mother years later ever thought getting special training Swimming Lacrosse - 2 sports I good School - replied 'Your father thought Sports men' that. Mike now lawyer happily married twin sons aged 4. My mother called last night Mike called hour earlier. He binge-watched The Queen's Gambit memories came flooding back. He picked phone tore Dad, son anymore, never able see twins again. He payback years forced something interested in. Dad broke soon hung up, mother upset. She called back already blocked numbers. She called happened. I called Mike answer. I hung up, texted saying things Dad, call back apologise. Mike replied stating blocking number too. I replied, called vindictive person deprive parents grandchildren's company affection something took place years ago. AITA? Some background; wife I worked lived somewhat larger city daughter born. My wife job opportunity employers field offices good pass up. We moved boonies daughter (Amy) pre-teen ever since. The people nice quickly labeled "city folk" never really integrated well. Amy came back summer freshman sophomore yea. She summer job met Fiancé (Dan). We house countless times since polite, respectful, seems truly love daughter. He local family locals generations. We rarely met parents, also seemed nice did. They dated long distance college years. This past summer engaged. His parents decided throw engagement last weekend house. We never I excited see home grew meet extended family. The party fine, best fit but, I mentioned, city poked fun little bit. His dad gave speech overtly racist, mentioned happy son found "nice white girl" looking forward "white grandbabies." As night progressed, started share bit family history "proud" lineage family now part of. Without going much detail, descended members hate group. We decided polite say anything stay much longer. I let stew days Amy returned home. She tells aware family history change mind. I marrying family I so. She says Dan wholly believe parents I'm convinced. You raised believe superior race becomes internalized degree. She assures lifetime point ways parents wrong. But I worried never leave hometown, will much pushback family. I I going firm this. That I marrying family. She called asshole ignoring ever since. I feel horrible I hoped her. So right? Am I asshole?My(F21) sister(25) first baby months ago. He, “James”, born completely healthy, go home day. She easy pregnancy delivery(said herself) reason always freaking thinking something wrong baby. About week James born, sister call pediatrician saying needed redo newborn screenings close borderline. My sister started freaking out, crying, acting meant going die even though hadn’t diagnosed anything even failed test; needed redo safe. He passed second time. Her next freak came 7 weeks old. She started saying hadn’t smiled yet everyone knew babies started smiling 6 weeks saying maybe early sign autism. My parents kept saying it’s completely normal baby smile right pediatrician even weren’t concerned extremely upset stressed this. I asked love less autism that’s acting looked disgusted course not, wants okay. He smiled days freak out. The recent freak first roll. He rolled first 12 weeks seems something parents excited nope, worried rolled early sign cerebral palsy. I’ve read early rolling can early sign 12 weeks considered “early rolling”. I finally fed lucky healthy baby people kill lucky needs stop freaking grateful. I starting look wants something wrong him. She something “okay sorry I won’t talk health concerns anymore” distant since. I recently found made new family group chat without sends pictures updates it’s making wonder I went far hurt feelings. AITA? ETA: My sister always anxious, therapy since 14 still is. Has also various meds. I guess I’m mostly frustrated seems ideal life doesn’t seem appreciative. She extremely supportive husband, house, gets SAHM, pregnant first try. But now reading replies I realize I didn’t really think hormones she’s probably wanting reassurance someone tell everything okay. I will apologize I’m gonna give bit can cool off.[removed]My mom wife avoid can. There never big incident. My mom JNMIL wife horrible DIL, can away speaking, speak. For little mom tried keep close relationship trying see wife there, I felt weird that, life busy, I mom times I available wife there, mom lost interest seeing me. In four years I've married I've seen mom handful times. It hard while, I feel I going two interact. My mom sent gift 3 old born, met couple times. My mom always polite see her, obviously traditional grandma role come around. My wife's family lives across country, spend holidays family. My mom hosting, I forcing wife uncomfortable situation.

He says girls there, rest boys will blame stepdad making decision. My fiancé asked do, I allow girls. I think sad son view I think allowing *him* go boys event, allowing furthered influenced type toxicity. WIBTA/AITA I allow go, telling fiancé allow girls? **UPDATE** Some context. My son 13. By community thing, I mean started dad sons boys community 2009 12-14. So technically private thing. His boys obviously older now longer go, help organize everything pay everything, along dad's neighborhood. The general age boys 12 14, sometimes little older, sometimes little younger. Long story short, fiancé taking them. The boys went, girls included. I hesitant let son go strong position girls, apparently boys started bullying whole thing, decided go anyway. My fiancé I started planning impromptu girl's trip, dads organize boys' trips parents went around bad mouthing fiancé I everyone girls wanted go, sudden couldn't.

Spent holidays beach locked inside phone, protested anytime included activity, usual shit. But I think ahe crossed line something it. For birthdays, usually together uncle grandparents family dinner. This celebrating friends, wanted nothing family sick us controlling telling do. She threw big fit, raising voice playing victim. My wife hurt, trying reason budge, birthday fiends come first settle another day WE celebrate. Of course make come dinner mean long faces around, bitching picking fights small things, seems counterproductive celebration her. I'm really sick shit, cruel us treating us comtempt. I say completely skip birthday wants, also means cake, presents money, celebration kind (she's expecting expensive presents money relatives) . But wife says going far will remember life. I starts consequences actions maybe will learn something. But also I'm doubting realy accomplish anything will drive farther us. What think? &#x200B; Edit: Sorry, I think I clear enough. English first language, I put disclaimer. She family gathering people involved I present (uncle, grandparents, mother) everybody celebrate family date ever, another day important us. We can set another date since made clear interested awkward. As controlling her, main complaints coming home 9,30 PM asking with. The less standard around here. And I "apparently responsible" I meant "as far know". But months ago found started smoking maybe things know. Anyway, I accept almost unanymous Asshole judgment. We'll tell decide wants do.My son 3rd grade, birthday party coming up. I gave roughly 9 10 invites invite friends wanted come give parents call me. When I go pick end day, teacher waves over. I asked up, I son pass invites enough whole class. I asked class passed math class cause friends were. I turned back I afford hold party almost 25 30 kids attend.

She apologize class tommorow. I pretty upset I I addressing principal later. Me son went home. I really see issue, I invite poor classmates. AITA?Me (26F) BF (28M) together almost 4 years. Over years spent extended periods families. We try alternate major holidays family visiting requires travel. We also try split summer trips well. Two summers ago spent 10-days family lake property. It relaxing great getaway us. There minor hang-up though. My BF's grandparents lake property well BF asked I dress respectfully around them. Now, I take lot pride body spend lot effort keep looking good. So, I show off. I wear skimpy bikinis piercings, sue me. My BF try stop wearing swimming boat, ask I least wear sports bras something cover around family. For part, I did. But times hot uncomfortable wear bra I wear crop top whatever I on. My BF called afterwards family members ask it, I shrugged off. Well, decided spend Labor day family. We rented cabin I really looking forward it. Until stunt BF pulled. He needed buy new swimsuit since getting old. Now, BF big clothes/fashion guy, I kind surprised ordered swimsuit trendy online store heard about. What I ordered swimsuit incredibly short inseam also very, tight. The first tried I literally see everything. Like, even though everything technically covered, nothing left imagination. I way going wear around family. He comfortable likes go shopping anything else. I kids literally looks sausage. I asked kind petty revenge wearing bra around family 2 years ago pissed even insinuating that. He wanted try something new fun idea shorts fit way do, change fact likes feels confident them.

I asked wife even let daughter buy crap since Ana used piggy bank money, wanted pick cologne (so basically Ana went Amazon, randomly looked around saw cologne picture liked afford). My wife thought whole thing hilarious, I really find funny. Don't wrong, I appreciated it, stunk I sent back today. I going say anything, I came back inside, Ana asked I went without putting cologne. And I her, "Well, sweetie, Daddy really it, I sent back, I appreciate getting gift, money spent (about $20) extra (another $20)". And really sad said, "You it?" And I said, "No, okay I'm happy even thought enough break piggy bank present." I heck kids - listen! She ran wife I I "hated" present"! I hate it, even I said! My wife I apologize, I no, apologize what? I turning spoiled. This good lesson learn. If listened wife trying help pick cologne, picked cologne I didnt like, I send back. I think apology unnecessary uncalled for. I gave Ana money back (and extra top that) I think leave that. Right now, everyone mad except twins (but babies). I going go apologize keep peace, I think about, I think I anything wrong worth apologizing for. Did I??My MIL I okish, extremely distant relationship. She self absorbed person I've ever met different people. I think happy son I engaged, part stays kids business.

She extended trash listed things mad about, consisted wedding, trying approve dress, attempting make fruit tarts "stolen" recipe, calling bad mom married FIL. last even DIL, I explained her. MIL believed still trashy married anniversary even "approach remind can leave early, hard feelings" At point I needed leave, called trashy three separate times. MIL called rude overdramatic, husband agreed ok FIL left. The last I saw really short pretty much ignored me. FIL speak me, honestly talk anyone except MIL seems hate us all. Even SIL BIL, pretty normal feel I went far "just expressing sister" mean hear it.[deleted]This throwaway. My stepdaughter 17 I married wife SD 13. We daughter 3. My SD dad never met him.

However, parents always provided us everything needed more. I say pretty good childhood, filled love care. Somehow, managed put us college, stopping us going debt. Sadly, means already hurt finances suffered even more. Out four us, Neza´s tuition expensive, since decided wanted go college state. We tried talk this, adamant 1.- Going state 2.- My parents paying her. In 5 years college, never job. About ago, parents confided wanted start saving retirement, unable since still paying loans took pay college expenses. I decided tell siblings came plan give parents “alimony” (don´t right word), parents able save money staying top bills. All siblings agreed contribute “alimony” I written proof that. I made arrangements, set account started paying. Since I came idea, I paying 50% total amount, twins pay 15% Neza pays rest. Neza hasn’t paying agreed almost since beginning. She always excuse pay even tho means it. Yesterday I went collect payment I realized Neza, again, made even money missing account. Not going lie, I furious, siblings I made agreement, violating that. I send text message: “This last I talk this. You moral obligation contribute parent’s finances given mostly ruined you. Make payment I will take account tell parent raised ungreatful woman”. She later called screaming yelling I father, can money whatever wants to. She parents made choice pay college owes nothing. I twins happened, agree me, also Neza right. She owe parents nothing, nice try repay them. AITA? EDIT: 1.- Neza massive tantrum threteaned cut contact parents pay college. Everything now parents chose support obligation to. 2.- I force sign ANYTHING. We, siblings, decided paying little alimony parents nothing comparison did. We ALL agreed this.

So, I daughters Mathematics Methods teacher years 9-11. A ago (beginning 2020) 10, daughter started acting suddenly home eventually school too. think friends who, honestly, complete asshole parents. Around middle year, start crying every single trip school, completely refusing go. On days I made go, end calling mother recess take home. On days refused bed, confiscate phone, keep weeks every time. still school-laptop though. This around daughter plainly respect me. In mid September 2020 so, daughter plainly respect/love wife, ever since completely ignored presence home. Skip forward 20201, actively avoids us, insults us, respect family. She ever comes room eat, never ever acknowledges us. She money drawings makes laptop, never buy anything except necessities, around 3 months ago came mother, casually telling us laptop old, crappy broken friend's kids using it. We usually buy gifts believe old enough actual job buy things, lazy refuses anything draw "anime" room. I've seen drawings there, porn. The women drawings naked, says way can afford anything buy anything. We reward behaviour new laptop. We Stern "No. Get job." started crying. again. Since then, every single conversation I've ended yelling me. Every single time. I'd tell dinner ready, tell "eat family actually gets family". hurts. I'd ask days reply "fuck off.". She's dramatic kid, life good. She job, go school, still free food place live yet still treats us this? The point is, I buy anything wants starts treating us actual respect. AITA buying laptop, even "needs" 'art'? EDIT: clarification: My daughter never really affectionate, refusing hug us anything usual. I originally take away phone bad grades, now take phone actively disrespects us. Yes, offer counselling ex-student mine. went weeks stopped going "crystals heal" even though calming.

She’s intelligent, gorgeous, ~~agreeable~~ compassionate, and, all, wonderful mother ~~firstborn~~ first (and only) child (5M). Our relationship was…hostile soon marriage due fertility issues. Eventually, however, reconciled blessed news son, since relationship uneventful. \[EDIT: Yes, argue! But open other, rarely go bed angry.\] As STAHM, cares son he’s home pre-school. I play active role son’s life well: I take walks, read sleep, play him, etc. However, due job I often home late, meaning often I am. This relevant. Now, issue: wife’s phobia stink bugs. Every spots hears squeals child, drives wall. It’s bad found crawling bed, refused sleep room next week. I offered find therapist, she’s refused. This wouldn’t much issue impact son. He's begun take mother. Now, whenever sees one, starts wailing her, unconsolable hours. It hurts seeing distraught; I don’t mind tears, knowing he’s hurting pains me—so much I’ve begun resent wife. Yesterday I snapped. I napping next son couch I jolted awake glass shattering wife squealing. Worried hurt, I raced kitchen, I found cowering corner, sobbing uncontrollably. When I asked happened, pointed glass shards floor, dropped plate stink bug. At moment, son began crying. I saw red barked wife, “This example set \[son's name\]?! Grow up!” To honest, I choice words—none I remember—before storming off. I tried apologizing last night, wouldn’t even look me. She sent text morning berating exploding front son, incident claims constitutes verbal abuse. AITA? **EDIT: To clear, I've begged receive help countless times years, always refused; even son, tell why. I understand repress it—I (am) upset least accept help.**[removed][deleted] My m30 fiancee f32 works security guard malls city. She's well educated smart.

His parents two sisters (Erin, 23 Jess, 21) drove Friday, hang Erin Jess go back school. We major plans, wanted hang other. However, ended drama husband's youngest sister I'm still kind annoyed. Here's weekend went: Everyone arrived Friday afternoon. Jess immediately us joining us dinner friends area (she went high school nearby) invited over. The rest us ate home, Jess came back pretty late. On Saturday, MIL treated me, Jess, Erin manicures morning, Jess us another friend invited brunch. Jess comes back brunch around 2, takes nap 4, tells us going concert friends. She left dinner, back late. Sunday drama happened. Jess slept kind late (until \~10), ate breakfast, pulled laptop. Jess asks husband wifi password. Husband wants for; Jess tells assignment due tomorrow needs work on. Husband asks work earlier weekend, Jess ignores question says needs wifi password. Husband says give helps mom clean (MIL always puts sheets towels laundry, vacuums, helps dishes leaves. She's pretty much ideal house guest). Jess gets mad, asks password. This I think I might asshole...I "sorry, I hear sound vacuum." Jess grabs car keys tells us going Starbucks can "actually fucking work done." She also going fail assignment us. Now everyone's stressed out, since trying leave 12 now someone persuade Jess come back pack stuff. They ended leaving lot later planned Jess say goodbye either us. I've always gotten along Jess, I can pretty demanding. On hand, I think assignment pressing, worked instead hanging friends weekend. So, AITA giving password? ETA: I mentioned comment Jess started yelling husband asked start assignment earlier. Then asked Erin password Erin ignored her. Then asked me. Some y'all seem stuck "chores" "make" guests do...MIL always strips bed, asks others put sheets towels wash. While that, MIL will vacuum put clean sheets bed. MIL asked Jess put stuff wash, Jess snapped "you it, I'm busy" eating breakfast. ETA2: AITA bestow verdict upon me, pretty clear will be. I appreciate comments PMs, fun read.

My older brother heard crying yelling basically calm yelled yelling Maya cat responsibility blame her, now I I'm AITA?I(42M) title sounds - there’s reason this! My wife (37F) I married well decade. We three kids (6,9,11) together, school. The issue housework become hot button topic us. Of course I tried help around house past constant critiques I housework made unsustainable. Here’s short list: -Dishes still wet put away -Dishes still “dirty” cleaning put (sometimes I accident miss spot, there’s small bit dried I can’t off) -didn’t hang dishcloths/counter towels (she thinks wet ones gross??) -Mixed clothes, bedding, towels load laundry (she says can’t washed way it’s “hard” sort that) -Didn’t washer time, claims can smell rewashes anyway -Didn’t change mop pad cleaning bathroom cleaning kitchen floor - even though I’m using bleach -Put leftovers away wrong (Yes really. Apparently using aluminum foil instead fishing Tupperware “wrong way”. ) I finally sick getting earful perfect I wanted help I going criticized everything way wants done. She actually stop helping I wasn’t going “good job” (according her). And honestly, she’s going redo everything it’s massive waste try help first place! So last years I’ve let thing standards. Both us work. I tradesman long, physical days. She, hand, substitute teacher high school. Now I teenagers can handful, it’s hardly taxing! Anyway huge fight dishes sink hadn’t washed piling up. She cooked, cleaned, worked, took care kids, laundry, asked “what exactly even contribute??” I’m hurt feels I don’t contribute I feel she’s TA critical instead appreciative help acting put upon decided herself. Most friends agree younger brother says I’m TA taking housework. TLDR: Wife criticizes every attempt help around house - AITA letting things way since she’ll redo anything I anyway? Edit: For context I raised household traditional roles values. When met page. Her views unfortunately changed family housework mostly going thing. I wouldn’t mind helping didn’t expect perfection!So I work head administrator Catholic school, means person makes final decisions priest order (which rotate four years). Each December make special Christmas Dinner employees let bring partner one. And problem is. One teachers (let’s call Dave) gay last Christmas Dinner (in 2019 wasn’t 2020 obvious reasons) brought male partner dinner. The head priest young “modern” ok it. But last head priest changed new lot conservative. For example, didn’t accept kid school parents allowed effeminate. So worry Dave brings partner priest will it. We don’t do, quite stressful least problem Christmas Dinner. So Dave asked date dinner I shouldn’t bring partner avoid causing conflict. But really mad it, I tried explain left. And look, I must suck able bring partner event this, works Catholic school. And I’m trying avoid conflict. Edit: Okay, I guess I didn’t explain well role priest. While technically employees I’m head administration, employees him. If wants can fired anyone school (including me) power him. So I can’t “force him” behave nicely.I recently engaged fiancée Abby. She amazing girl I happier. Abby I pretty modern relationship partners everything. During six years together talked lot marriage expectations. Abby's mom, Rose, made clear thought taking romance it. Abby I ended picking ring together talking proposal go. Rose kept making comments ruining it, surprised husband proposed, etc. For background I parents much. They extremely co-dependent relationship old school gender roles Rose expects treated absolute princess. Her dad James seem crazy me. I think wants take care daughter more, Abby need that. Rose seems put romantic enough, honestly annoys shit me. We spent holiday lake house. Abby I even went hike proposed back me. It great day. When I went bed night (Abby living room siblings) I heard James Rose talking shit. She cried made wait 6 years married. He made joke owes lot money Abby women pay half rings now. Then died tell friends proposed back jokingly made promise knees reason. Honestly I deal asshole. I went bedroom, opened door, stared them. James cussed room ever house again. I I heard conversation thought I going barf. No wants hear knees (honestly might dick move, extremely consuming routine look younger looks Abby's sister insecure age) James fuck called disrespectful. The next morning confronted me, apologize, I ever burst wife half naked going real problem. To clear covers. I Abby thinks hilarious, made Christmas awkward Rose telling everyone I respect raised right.One friends recently lost use lower body car accident. He good attitude managing independent lives normal life. We party mutual friend anna trying help him. She wanted always run drinks, food, everything him. He first relented later wanted things himself. She pay attention. As kept things finally appreciated please treat crash. She kept ignoring him. Finally pouring water tried take water hand pour snapped yelled stop helping. I yelled back trying help wheelchair doesnt mean can douce. I felt bad immediately angry. We spoken much since. AITA?Hey everyone. Throwaway account I’m pretty sure people involved story main. Recently, father returned home overseas spending several years away whole family, extended included, together throw party celebrate return. Clean house, put decorations, cook banquet, works. I took drive around town supplies, blow balloons, hang decorations even assisted mother preparations cooking. Among dishes mother making rather special I good memories eating dad, I pretty excited eat alongside everyone else. Problem is, day dad landed airport, others supposed go last second, remembered dad adored certain pastry that’s made bakery across city. Wanting make day perfect, I volunteered go grab even though it’d probably take hour-and-a-half. Well, series misfortunes, ended taking several hours store closed. Thankfully, knew owners I called begged open, did, I able obtain pastry. I called home everyone I’d gotten wait I back eat together. When I home, I found food over, everyone drinks. Unfortunately, food I’d wanting eat alongside father eaten everyone else. My mother saved minute portion meal however. After heartwarming reunion dad catching him, mother offered food she’d saved I refused claimed I wasn’t hungry. For life me, I didn’t single bite food prepared. Instead, I gave pastry dad surprise refused take bite either. Overall, still great time, except mother constantly asking eventually begging least two bites, everyone else also asking eat. My mother privately confided understood I peeved she’d spent long making me, child, wasn’t eating it, she’d feel she’d done hard work nothing, even everyone else eaten. I I wasn’t mad I wasn’t hungry. To honest, I’m pretty sure bullshit guilt eating. I wouldn’t take single bite food, anything else really, rest day. I suppose I angry everyone thoughtless enough started eating without even I’d asked to. Instead, I let displeasure felt heard. Am I asshole? EDIT: I clarify food eaten dinner. I left 4 back 8, dinner usually around 7-7:30. My dad home 5 everyone snacks. At 6:30 I called I’d gotten pastry wait I back cause Dinner would’ve served 30 minutes, gave assent.I teach middle school math class. One thing I trying students become better mental math, solving difficult questions using pencil paper. For test I give, I make clear whether allowed use calculator not. One students, Joe, struggling quite bit class. He IEP (individualized education plan), I try work individually improve skills. Unfortunately, take lessons seriously, bit disheartening. I gave math test last week, specified calculators allowed test. When everyone seated, Joe pulled calculator, I immediately went put away. However, allowed use calculator IEP, I needed accommodate him. I true - test supposed train math skills, using calculator defeating purpose. I fair allowed use calculator rest class wasn't. He budge. I tried put calculator way nearly minute, absolutely refused, students getting impatient starting test (I officially allowed writing begin since I busy speaking Joe). Finally, I took test paper hand pack things class, sent principal's office sent home. I also gave 0 test clearly cooperate me. Here's thing, ready write test wanted excused, I perfectly happy write another day. However, fact blatantly disrespected following instructions made less sympathetic towards him. Joe gone class couple days, last I heard suspended school. For extra info: There nothing IEP calculator use.[removed]I getting married "Adam" We amazing relationship, communicate great, best friend, come vastly different backgrounds. Adam grew extreme privilege due sometimes see things differently. When engaged parents "Scott Marie" gave us generous amount money pay wedding hinted money coming bought house. This unexpected. He youngest child knew done two. I little pause accepting much money, I put perspective much them, plus wanted son. Recently parents hosted cook invited Scott Marie families meet. Everything going alright parents huge drinkers. His hold alcohol well, I guess felt pressure keep up. So Scott wasted much talkative usual (I son 4 years never made effort me) talking dad something grew (low income government housing) My dad shocked made comment amazing come far. Now I knew background. Scott grew dirt poor. He brilliant totally self made. Someone best feeling give kids everything get, it? Scott "I wanted wife everything. She I now bad feelings I give kids stuff I'm fuck no, makes worth it." Marie aww, shit kids. I floored. I knew Scott cold man. I knew Adam best relationship him, shook core. I say anything point drunk, I Adam I wanted return money wedding can afford. Adam it, sat parents. I Marie began guilt tripping I'm shaming feelings people perfect. It's ok feels way "right thing" end. Scott say much rolled eyes. I adamant money going back. The venue money back thing I will keep, going much smaller wedding Adam feels I'm punishing dad fair. He huge extrovert, loves parties, salty this. Scott Marie think I'm ridiculous I money feels way. Me best friend known since kindergarten. Now we’re 20s still hang regularly. For context, overweight throughout childhood teens. I never judged course I cared personality more. Well last 3-4 years underwent something call “glow up” phase. He lost weight, shape even works personal trainer today. He looks unrecognizable now considered attractive people. Nowadays girls constantly hit gets LOTS female attention. This doesn’t bother since I’m romantically interested him. However frustratingly oblivious personality hasn’t changed much. He still doubts doesn’t believe women possibly find attractive. I find insecurity annoying I wish felt confident. I also find annoying every we’re together women flock him. At point I rarely enjoy spending him. A days ago invited dinner restaurant. The waitress clearly hitting I don’t think even registered presence. I thought attraction obvious course friend didn’t realize going on. He she’s “really nice”. Oh yeah…just nice…totally. So point I *explain* obviously desperate him. He denied I personality hasn’t changed much. He’s still chubby insecure kid I knew years that’s never gonna change, ever. He argued he’s person I gave bunch examples I think is. At end quiet visibly upset. The next day kinda made felt bad things okay-ish now. In opinion harsh ultimately tough love. I’ve lambasted friends (and even uninvited bday party) I’m wondering I’m truly asshole sensitive (he’s always super touchy btw).My daughter shopping two daughters yesterday (ages 10 12). Whilst I random text wife planning going ears pierced I o.k girls done. This bit random discussed I thought harm 2nd hole ear wrote back fine. A hours back returned. They proudly showed ears I see ear blinged bottom top. I informed 6 piercings ear going wait see reaction. Initially I thought fake sort practical joke alway splay other. I therefore played along went flick daughter's ear. When I went I noticed backings earrings big shock actually pierced. I blew started going irresponsible many ear piercings. In spur moment I also looks trashy daughter will longer job go good college. My wife daugters looked shocked saying I overreacting ear piercings I fine earlier. I responded 7 single ear way much disrespectful. l also asked remove I will mad every I see earrings. I feel betrayed tricked wife daughters. Also likely went cheap ass place mall teenager idea hygiene probably many without thinking consequences. I go place piercings expected better wife steer right direction. Everyone thinking I silly it. AITA here?[removed]We recently found wife pregnant (6 weeks) thrilled. We heading brothers house Christmas I took parents aside arrived brother, wife sister preoccupied brothers in-laws. Obviously parents thrilled too, tried show anything brothers wife miscarriage 3 weeks ago. Obviously wife wasn’t drinking sick siblings became suspicious I too, asked make big deal don’t people yet brothers laws next room. However, brother wife started crying rest Christmas. She isn’t real close family didn’t things became awkward obviously upset nobody knew why. I feel wanted share joy plan tell anyone parents, circumstances changed siblings knew already I them. I didn’t expect sister law find upset. AITA here?I work industry really common people date marry within industry. We've three couples married within past five years, lots relationship drama general, I find exhausting honest, I wish people date outside work. Some guy "Brett" started tradition getting small cheap grocery store cake encouraging (pressuring) couple smear other. He claims us attend weddings due work, says good fun. One thing I noticed man usually receptive woman, sometimes says anyway, really bothers me. Also Brett kind creeps I think likes seeing happen. The department head getting married January Brett brought cake. I actually think it, bit older (40s others 20s) higher position. He woman ended covered cake, significantly less him. Honestly I annoyed sexism, also almost bumped me. I finally dumb unprofessional thing work sexist, men always way woman gets messier, old boys club shit needs stop 2021. Brett relax. The bride called exhausting asked I jealous. Everyone seemed agree I woke, friend expressed private I I might offended department head powerful, Brett woman involved also much power I do. Honestly I think need call sexism stupidity day age.My first wife I dated HS. But HS - I enlisted, went college. But never broke up. We always intended back together, did.

My wife says there’s point giving ex wife money since cheated didn’t support. She claimed quarter every check way much. Since I make 80k taxes. She says going towards future ex. But ex gave career stay home. All cause I didn’t shame stay home dad. She says I’m hole that, hole putting first? But that’s really it’s me. I don’t mind supporting her. I mean…what husband leaves her? What will do? We’re 40s, wife son takes care now. My daughter 23. As timeline : enlisted 17, discharged 22, married 25, currently 48. (Ex) wife 49. Wife 40.

We’ve dating 4 years thinking getting married making question serious relationship. The area live expensive we’d need buy house together even quality mortgage apartment won’t least help I savings paid student loans. I feel I’m way invested relationship won’t put money mouth is. When dog needed surgery also wouldn’t help I asked take personal loan dog. I angry since cared dog says she’s stepmom won’t help cover medical expenses. I dog relationship he’s life 4 years now won’t contribute apart buying gift every b day.My husband I, 50, first married 18. We baby (Adam, now 30) divorced soon after. We definitely ready married life parenthood, worked better co-parents couple, things ten years afterwards, husband child someone else. When daughter (Stella, now 24) 4, together now married 18 years kid. Stella split house mother's since 5, lived us full since 18. Where are, quite common adult children live parents financially stable move someone. Adam lived us married 27 Stella still lives us. Stella good money started working, started charging "rent" help save (she knows put money savings account her). We never Adam, always responsible finances. Adam now lives hour away baby. He works 4 days week wife still maternity leave days row, come stay us. These days always fall weekends. The problem Stella works home sometimes needs work nights. Some nights fallen days Adam here. The last happened, Stella extremely upset baby cried lot boss call "unprofessional". So, asked us possible Adam come work nights. We no, Adam able come work allows make stays even rarer. We available bedrooms move into, best try convert part garage little workstation her. She really angry again, says garage comfortable move workspace Adam stays occasionally.

They also support system live, hence come us often.[deleted][removed]Hi everyone. I using names genders post. When I 7 years old (I'm 21 now), mother decided adopt 2 old cat rescue centre. This cat previously street cat. Despite various attempts become "friends" cat, never really took me. By I mean never let near food, hiss I went near belongings, claw I petted wrong place. We eventually learned coexist. Recently, I encountered stray Bulldog local park. After taking dog local vets, appropriate checks, ensuring wanted claim dog, I decided adopt dog, since I end system. My family ok adopting it. The cat, however, not. We made sure keep dog away cat behind closed doors adjustment period, tried introduce via smells, avail. Eventually accepted never best friends. However, cat began actively seek dog threaten it. There times I'd playing dog floor, cat began hissing us both. This came head dog sleeping sofa, cat leapt him. I'm normally opinion older pet stay situation arises need rehomed. However, sending dog back system account cat trying hurt seemed awful thing do. I voiced concerns mother, agreed me, since I think, bad sounds, waiting cat die, since felt bad it. We took cat local animal shelter. My friend recently called say saw cat shelters website. When I happened, blew me, saying I'm "disgusting" choosing "ugly" breed dog cat, I'm terrible pet owner. I go detail said, I'm aware character limit. AITA? EDIT: My "friend" will adopt cat. I'm longer speaking now, I also anything cat, maybe overreactors can stop sending threats dm's now. :)I 40s/m "Beth" 30s/f. We work roughly equivalent station office. Beth always closed book personal life, lately interactions made wonder going behind scenes. I able find several accounts online, including socials forums. These easy enough find Google bit conjecture. I discovered Beth vocal several platforms severe personality disorder drinking problem. Many concerns I before, clicked place: long history Monday morning sick days, mediation processes always seemed end favor (which clearly due manipulation related disorder), way always seemed able wheedle extra attention special privileges supervisors. I reported information direct supervisor. From point view, certainly right anything impacts workforce manages. It seems thought I right thing grateful hear information, I since several co-workers unanimously I invaded privacy not-so-pleasant accusations. In main I think I took right action, AITA?[removed]My (30F) brother (34m) lives across country I still live city parents (65/66). For parents go see family (wife, two kids ages 1 3) used 4-5 hour direct flight staffing shortages now offer connections.

After parents discussion brother wife, sister-in-law texted mom group chat brother saying kids disappointed seeing grandma grandpa. Then went say new normal parents need think risks willing take see grandkids sometimes sacrifice. She ended "it's sad see afraid 'what ifs' risk seeing grandbabies, thought see grow up." I call brother tell muzzle wife parents decide none concern. I understand stay home mom probably looks forward help break, parents disability mom watches kids night per week comes 2-3 days per week help out. And never financial help big gifts parents since limited income. My brother tends backbone wife basically well-done noodle. My husband I rule manage families, I think needs institute wife. So Reddit, I AH I called brother talk wife mom downright disrespectful parents done them? Can I say needs start talking sense wife give reality check everything revolves around ever says anything again?We closed house two months ago, take residence home 3 weeks ago previous owners unable move then.

She telling big team meeting (virtual) boss 4 people her. That means will probably 30 people meeting. I asked going make pretty then. She immediately annoyed something like, "no, I'm going dress I usually do, wears t-shits meetings big deal". I usually wears jeans shirts I classify step t-shirts, step wear office. I've asked question many times always gets annoyed, I understand why...I mean, question, I'm making conversation. Is overreacting AITA?My girlfriend [30] live [35] yet. And hesitant point. I coming night owl kids. But tell parent made rather angry her. I 2 kids ex wife. They're 4 10. I've tried morning routines past NEVER worked. My kids naturally tired midnight (and sometimes 1am) I allow stay then. Despite late bedtime, still technically enough sleep per day. I'll school around 7am school, I'll take long nap. When back, take 3-5 hour nap, totals 9-12 hours sleep per day. The 10 old great school 4 old fine I see reason change things. This routine/preference well mine. They're night owls me. I've tried sleep earlier rarely fall asleep earlier midnight. My girlfriend hand gets tired around 9-10pm goes bed visiting days time. She issue kids still gone bed. She says can still hear even though bedroom (that I let sleep in) door closed goes bed. She morning too, unlike kids, difficulty taking naps thus goes bed earlier rest us. I personally problem if/when I fall asleep kids I can sleep anything I work home. She recently I need better routine kids. I mad telling parent kids house. Now wants visit even less. I tried getting understand family filled night owls. It's way kids I are. They still plenty sleep thanks long naps take school/preschool. AITA getting mad her? I raise voice bit parent, I'd rather raise kids parenting working (and therefore need changing). I also grew extremely strict parents put many rules I kid, including early bedtime, I eventually become depressed I lay bed hours without even falling asleep (because I've always night owl). I subject kids that.I'm 30 next year, three relationship broke May. As can imagine, rough weird first Christmas without them. My aunt almost 60 unmarried. She quite peculiar gets hyper lot things. When went visit today Christmas FIRST question "well new man yet?" I immediately replied "well you, come married yet?" She stayed quiet LONG rest cousins, mum aunts carried conversation. On way home Mum I rude answer way, taking interest making conversation. AITA reply?I'm getting married spring. Me fiance mid thirties. I knew exactly I wanted dress, I love mermaid cut flares knee I wanted show cleavage shoulders keep breezy potentially humid wedding. The women sides family wanted try dresses see liked them. My Aunt dads side (60s) married late seventies early eighties dress hideous. I real intention wearing dresses presented me, I went along heirloom fitting fun appease family. Well grandmother I ended wanting dresses check box 'something borrowed' I idea. I lied I liked aunts dress I considering wearing wedding. My idea I take already ugly dress someone I closest seamstress use make dress exact specifications cheaper new dress rack making completely scratch. I took altered closer I wanted. When aunt give dress back I going wear I truth showed I done. She lost shit saying I ruined dress I I favor updating I'd give back since fabric originally hers. The seamstress used lot bodice lace dress added chiffon things. She demanded I give dress back I did, since dress mostly also informed will attending wedding speaking being. I really care super close whole dads side upset it. AITA?I come fat family, I recently managed lose weight. I now eat healthy diet exercise daily. It's made realize unhealthy family's eating habits I encouraged child overeat. Unfortunately youngest sister baby family 14, heading way. She gaining weight quickly eats whatever likes. Our parents halfheartedly put diets gets angry gives up. I've tried educate diets seem interested. Today I brought back food I put tubs fridge. For first months, I bought cake I weighed also put fridge. Later day, parents late home clearly wait extra 20 minutes food, decided eat ALL cake plus fried tofu I made. I really angry I starving, looking forward day eaten "junk food" months. I "_____ can fat pig f–ing day? You enough food without eating mine. It's actually disgusting much eat" She upset ran room crying. Our parents think nasty, I admit ate food I'd bought weighed myself...She problems depression stuff obviously I encourage, weight main reasons depressed. She gets constant positive encouragement overeating weight, I I young. Maybe shaming way her? I me. AITA? So situation: I (25F) live cousin Bree (27F) small 3 bedroom townhouse last welcomed another roommate "Claude" (25M) rent 3rd room. From beginning, Claude us gay long distance boyfriend. Both cousin assumed "gay" meant exclusively attracted men NOT women. With us, Claude refer gay ... never bi bisexual. Obviously assumed male attracted only. Because assumed roomate Claude gay, Bree I let guards came clothing... We'd walk around house skimpy clothing underwear time, especially hot day. We felt comfortable coming shower small towel walking around house sitting couch small towel wrapped around bodies cover us. When came home work often take bras walk around house braless. We'd also often walk around shirt panties. Claude perfectly okay (we checked make sure uncomfortable female half nudity), again, assumed male attracted issue... So recently Claude broke long distance boyfriend. He's tinder yesterday showed picture someone going date Saturday ...she's woman??? I obviously confused asked Claude "umm, going date woman? I thought gay??" Claude laughed actually bisexual, usually referred gay. I admit, I pretty upset. I asked 12 months living us never us bisexual? He asked big deal I never walked around house underwear I knew also attracted women. I also Claude should've known better upfront bisexual moving 2 women. Because say "gay" course going assume mean male attracted unless state otherwise. Claude upset called biphobic ... I I wasn't, I upset disclose also attracted women moving 2 women... especially considering Bree I walking around half nude assumption liked men. Why clarify bisexual us earlier ??? So I guess I wanted ask sub, I biphobic asshole? Maybe I I'm seeing it...My daughter weighs less 40 pounds. She lots energy, loves active. She running back forth hallway morning downstairs neighbor yelled open window “stop running it’s fucking inconsiderate!” It roughly 10 Sunday. I totally understand early morning late night, adult running around. But 3 yo middle day? I already daughter can’t run much, telling she’s allowed run apartment seems crazy me. AITA? Edit: Thanks input. Here additional context. I lived apartment 3.5 months, second neighbor anything me, first first day I moved in, asked something along lines “moving in?”. She frequently plays loud rap music explicit lyrics bass shaking walls. She also four wind chimes patio (which apartment rules). Despite I never thought complaining I accept it’s part living apartment, hearing neighbors. I’ve definitely never thought yelling window, that’s tacky trashy. A couple things I’m surprised regarding responses: 1) I’m genuinely surprised many people consider 10 early. I agree 10 early work overnight shift (she not). 2) Nobody seems problem disparity action reaction. My daughter accidentally annoyed person response hurl f-bomb daughter’s direction (fortunately didn’t hear it). Is really appropriate response? If person come door reasonable adult way daughter’s running preventing sleeping, OF COURSE I tell daughter stop. She opposite. Up today I idea bothering all.I've online dating quite while. My profile clearly states,” I'm dating marriage end goal”. I matched weeks ago charming woman also dating intent married, caveat wanting traditional relationship housewife. I agree I happy arrangement, future. We chat variety subjects set date early dinner two weeks (today). Much surprise, date, casually mentions children. In confusion, I ask her, “but looking become housewife?” She responds, “you can housewife still children”. Admittedly, I chuckle, full belly roar laugh, chuckle. She took great offense laugh asks, “why childfree housewife”. My response was, ”what will day?” She says, ”what older housewives children go own” response was, “usually back work”. I going next impossible find man willing take deal. She gets angry leaves. I tell sister thinks I “crushed poor woman's dreams” Am I asshole, telling truth?[removed]I found I’m pregnant days ago, news couldn’t come worse I didn’t anyone else know. We’re currently vacation in-laws MIL’s birthday. When I took test, everybody gone SIL came home unexpectedly I hide it. I panicked shoved draw. I intending go back dispose I couldn’t away SIL long enough everyone else came home. My husband ended finding test asked it. I wasn’t mine automatically assumed sister’s she’s trying conceive acting weird recently. He privately congratulated found wasn’t hers. She started crying fertility issues test wasn’t hers. When confronted it, I didn’t admit truth suggested might’ve someone else’s. He bullshit suggested I take test front prove wasn’t mine. Since I knew I caught I admitted truth. AITA?Throwaway. This turning real issue (35f) fiance (40m), I use perspective I something wrong. My fiance I together two years. We’ve recently moved together, house three kids- son, Sean(15m) twins(Jason Jack, 17m). The problem particularly concerns Jack. When fourteen, expressed depressive thoughts, something made fiance think really serious. Jack daydreams "phases out" lot, can obsessive interests nobody else shares (my fiance mentioned anxiety depressive disorders). The twins' late mom artsy sort person left behind bunch drawing books journals fiance kids treat historical artifacts I've gathered Jack lot (important). My fiance Jason treat Jack made glass. Sean goes school twins tells Jason walks Jack classes practice, sits meals makes sure eats plenty, honestly home. I've noticed two excluding Sean deliberately things do, amateur musicianship, general lots inside jokes personal communication, I think basically due Jack- Jason can pretty social moment away brother, Jack closed introverted. Sean really eager friends Jason, well liked school despite spending lot anyone except Jack. My fiance basically treats Jack way (lets Jack messy, doesn;t make fix sleep schedule, set bar low "if alive you’re good"), refuses talk make Jack friendlier Sean me- alienating, I feel Jack house. I think way everyone treats Jack good him, I suspicion fiance soft spot resembles mom. I mentioned fiance boys' codependence concerning me, maybe Jack better come around people Jason spent apart, fiance considered seriously. When went talk boys trying spend apart, blew him. They think I'm involved affairs, I honestly best development people, healthy two people spend much together, good Jack coddled much. Now Jack starting say feel comfortable space me, Jason always backing up. My fiance really upset strict kids, boys might trying convince break engagement. AITA, really giant thing called codependent? Edit: I it. I asshole thing. I've since conversation boys father sides apologized; father I decided take break give boys space next months going stressful them. &#x200B;I F25 daughter 7 old cheerleader.

My salary Rs.30,000 428 us dollarsMy (56f) oldest daughter (26f) I strained relationship pretty much since middle school. We often shouting matches clothes (she need wearing tank tops short shorts 13!), school (she often lazy study unless I made her, worked - always straight A's), extracurriculars (I let quit violin piano good them. She also wanted gymnastics ice skating, wanted start those, late good them). She went boarding school high school rarely called visited. Same went college. I made many attempts fostering better relationship her, pretty much never answered phone. She paid education really ask anything. Eventually I accepted close. Her sister (24f) hand much better behaved. If I something, complain much. She studied without yelled at, I even arguments her. We great relationship.

I agreed, daughter I care her, I that. However, less hour coming stay me, screaming match. All I express sad I longer went church cared God, somehow made go crazy. She asked space, whenever I tried talking (a couple times day), arguments. Eventually, I feeling stressed, I decided tell probably best move out, I happy support emotionally. She screamed I never anything growing up, always favored sister. Which true. Her sister better behaved her. Sarah moved out, I tried asking lunch times come Christmas, ignores me. I feel I'm trying best, hard along with. AITA?I'm party person. I'll put upfront. Saturday went bf's sister's first b-day. First huge party, mostly adults, actual bar, I kind fuck? His mom came greet birthday girl dressed Hawaiian skirt lei (they hawaiian) His stepdad even wearing shirt, I thought kind bizarre. The baby normal stuff cake presents, baby games, lot drinking.

At point baby cake mom stepdad licked point I felt I frat party. Then mom started screaming grandma saying baby's name made trashy (it Soraya, Persian dad is) She flipped mom someone cheered. I I going go getting annoying. He texted asked I left, I reasons I stated really trashy scene. He called judgmental, rude, I even trying family. He sent video baby dancing "yeah clearly miserable", partyMy brother SIL threw housewarming party couple days ago. It's planned weeks wife I planning attending.

I ask wife wants take meds still attend party, says rather stay bed. I ask I can anything says no. So, I start ready go. By I'm ready, wife asleep I tell MIL I leaving. I make sure everything needs son pretty much tells go fun this. So I brother's place start enjoying myself. A hours I arrive wife starts texting asking I'm coming home. I tell I've already drinks planning staying planned before. She I stop drinking sober I can come home night since feeling well. I ended calling rather texting asked felt I needed come home. She feels bad MIL watching son sick I come home help out. I I even feel comfortable driving least 2 hours, hour drive home, I back son getting ready bed anyway. She says "Whatever, fun." hangs up. So, I do. I enjoy rest night crash brother's place. I morning, grab coffee hit road I'm home around 9am. My wife still asleep I leave be. MIL son finishing breakfast MIL wants hang bit, go walk.

Am I really asshole here?[deleted]I (F18) home alone watching TV I saw sister's husband "J" (sis hubby live us) pulls starts walking door. I idea parents—who grocery shopping still out—gave notice that'd stopping by. So starts knocking, I sheepishly answer door pajamas bed head, clearly confused. I greeted asked politely I word it. He dad going work van come home grocery store. I like, "Oh, okay!" going wait outside van. No problem! I went back watching TV soon I sat mom texted way J coming over. Thanks... 15 minutes later parents home dad J garage working van, I mom happened I upset embarrassed tell J br coming. She I rude asking "forgot" tell me. We argued bit now talking me, now naturally dad either, reddit, AITA? EDIT: Hi! So I'm editing clarify bit! First off, I'd address comments implying I'm BIL. Those made uncomfortable 10 years older I turned 18. I feel embarrassed mom invited ladies warnings, albeit rare, I'm self conscious looks smell I showered brushed teeth morning. Second, BIL inside conversation. He wait car. I also loud tiny dog barks anything moves familiar with, may also factor though I'm sure. Third, argument mother started I telling Jand I's awkward encounter. She I rude, I replied little rude inconsiderate let coming. That's started yelling me. Lastly, people saying thing along lines parents need permission people house. I know! I say did, I asked heads up. Hope helps! EDIT 2: Also !!! I really hate "he's family" thing. My two sisters mothers m*lested "family." So I will accept judgment included reasoning. But I respect I argued mom I'm AH THAT.Long story short: - My gf’s family tradition make presents EVERYONE: uncles, aunts, cousins, etc… spend hundreds hundreds dollars year. - My side family doesn’t make presents. I make gift parents, that’s all, even sister, I don’t ask presents return. We enjoy other’s company bake cookies / stuff. Now, insists marry I participate tradition. I politely no. (I don’t much money I landed good job, I start saving buy stuff I like. Also, I’m extremely difficult please hate 99.999% presents I get). This blew argument I can buy stupid stuff wants money, will separate bank accounts. She choose presents herself, say us, I need split money, I refused waste money people I barely don’t give single f*ck about, I don’t even make presents sister. She me: “What make present?”. I answered: “I tell everyone beforehand I don’t I won’t make I don’t feel people never present right” She went crazy, I’m extreme social conventions required follow I better find another girlfriend I’m willing least meet halfway.[removed]I (38M) two kids, call Emma (11F) Jacob (13M). Emma expressed interest playing guitar, I bought birthday. I also beginner guitar instruction books help started. A week later asked start taking lessons. She barely touched guitar since birthday, I play guitar more, consider it? She kept pushing it, I lessons expensive I make sure really willing put effort commit that. I asked learn book/CD "I learn that, I take real lessons" I I play guitar really wants lessons put effort. At point begging practically throwing fit, says "If play guitar lessons!" So I no, end discussion, sent room giving attitude. Fast forward couple weeks. Jacob teaching guitar. On days play hours end. So I decide sign lessons, since clearly invested Emma showing initiative I reward for. Emma outraged this, since logic HER guitar SHE taking lessons, him. I never plays guitar, take lessons. Their mom (my ex) thinks I'm TA "she's kid, kids need structure guidance learn" plus thinks Emma must feel super betrayed I guitar brother lessons instead her, even accused favoritism. She says put Emma lessons afford (I make significantly does). Emma good musical ear (she sings school choir) I pursue talents, I spend money lessons never going practice, plus I feel I lessons I'll teaching can wants whining begging. So, AITA?It sounds bad hear out. My dad rich businessman paying expensive wedding. His relationship fiancé(D) little strained, SIL (H)outright hate other. I D come different cultural backgrounds, planning getting married twice (both christian wedding followed indian months) D's parents paying Indian wedding. H came lesbian years ago family cut ties her. Everyone except D, made grow much closer years. (They already close due 2 years apart) My dad religious homophobic, agree him/are close him. He's good hiding views affect business. H also lawyer take shit anyone obviously hate other. Now dad called days ago wanted continue sponsor wedding, uninvite H. One friends long client persuaded business 'religious bigot' I option agree, since lot stuff booked (venue, plane tickets, hotel rooms) agreed. I called H happened quietly agreed uninvited first wedding. When D it, flipped out. He's rarely ever angry me, day LIVID. After minutes yelling, calmed calm voice "I'm either getting married sister present, I'm getting married." I loss here. Having pay stuff pockets seriously hurt finances. H tried convince brother let go, budge. Was really outrageous idea? Umm small clarification dad lose money cancel, will. Even cancel thw wedding, hotel rooms flights non refundable. We well dad is. Idk changes anything, big wedding, US losing lot money deposits non refundable bookings Since still getting replies, yes, H invited Indian wedding D cut anyone trying homophobic guest list. It's 25 people now. We planned wedding beforehand, dad offered pay us expand guest list (essentially x2.5) D still wanted pay close family, dad asked us book rooms venue pay us back end month. So big wedding, losing lot money booking. IT IS NOT ABOUT NOT HAVING A BIG WEDDING. IT IS ABOUT LOSING ALL OF THE MONEY WE HAD PAYED IF HE DOESN'T PAY US BACK. And anyone asking revenge dad telling everyone happened - nobody's going believe him. I people trying troll everyon comment make, via comments section, dms chat, respons : The first wedding already (if read comments) people make sound I'm payed this. We lost lot money here, easy pretend care money sound high mighty "oh, care money" starting new life someone, big financial loss going mess plans.

I WAS THERE, happened, saw go down, stayed awake supporting cried cleaned H threw hours crying D consoled her. See, things go relationship last 9 years. That answer "why cut dad" "why fiance even you" "you homophobic money" comments also therapeutic rant, responding new comments anymore. I accepted judgementAITA deleting boyfriend’s Chess account?

When tried some, realised done really angry. He inedible (it wasn't. I enjoyed lot going go waste.) And make something else.

ETA: I'm talking pepper "salt pepper" blended peppercorns, pre-ground lmao EDIT: something probably worth adding post boyfriend adds garlic everything I hate garlic refuses make dish without it. It's I think fair add bit pepper I put ingredient I dislike constantly. I mention I think relevant I think might now. And yes, *he insists I add garlic every dish cook too* update: boyfriend I made last night, I apologised ruining chicken soup, accepted apology. But morning, another fight I maybe start cooking instead other, since different things food. He likes lot garlic, I don't. I lot black pepper, doesn't. I either make separate portions, add garlic portion meant him, black pepper portion meant me. He idea created work. I maybe cook other. And days work late, can eat leftovers dinner night before.

I (29, F) getting married fiance (30, M) two weeks. One pet peeves people bride wear white weddings. In US - especially midwest (if here), well-known NO NO, seen disrespectful. We family wedding couple weekends ago, I noticed two family members also attending wedding wearing white (probably closer cream) pantsuit dress. The issue is, play dumb act heard basic wedding etiquette. My solution buy cheap bright green t-shirts write sharpie "I wore white wedding", wedding coordinator can hand guests breaking "rule".

It's forgets things, problem putting chores thinks can take older kids him. Our 11 7 olds zero interest going golfing fishing husband friends I'm going force that. So I've pretty much husband wants friend time, needs plan advance can schedule around needed. To credit, this, still feels missing things wants friends. He says feels robot takes orders half autonomy make decisions. He says strict adherence scheduling things makes feel smothered I remind schedules reason lives complete chaos (or already are).

My fiancé see way (and matters) I largely clean shaven last several years. This relevant story perhaps context helpful. My fiancé sent itinerary groomsmen day wedding notes involved "clean shaven." My friends assumed meant, essentially, clean look sloppy - fiancé fact mean please clean shaven pictures etc. I think friends look sloppy beards/stubble, does, are. For me, big deal shave day, fiancé firm this. Objectively I care either way, I back. WIBTA making this? Is bridezilla? I've seen many posts things brides make bridesmaids think even spectrum, I need outside opinion. EDIT: comments asked info clarification adding here: Of groomsmen, longer, fuller beard rest, going several years. Fiancé say person exempted. However another friend "shaved" years (i.e. fully clean shaven) rather trims stubble every days so, exempt. He considers beard/style. So I suppose added layer point stubble become facial hairstyle, even matters still requesting something do. That negate comments discussing commitment growing beard takes time, still request change appearance sake wedding.[removed][removed]My daughter (17) senior high school.

We seeing long term hopefully even though can alittle stubborn every relationships shells layers can peeled takes that’s fine. I makeup isn’t important it’s small compromise. I’m forcing anything free whatever wants body. I’m 100% supportive decisions lifeBackstory: (m33) girlfriend (f29) met, getting breakup. Initially wasn’t ready date anyone, I offered hang friends, eventually lead happy relationship months. Fast forward later. She happened run ex grocery store, kind looked good happy. I asked missed confessed miss sometimes, worry, wanted truthful I asked. This I thought might funny play little prank her… left phone unattended I replaced contact info phone work phone number (that never uses.) Later night, I texted work phone look text him, saying nice see I missed her. About 15 minutes I sent text, texted screenshot text “her ex” asked reply. I relieved also thought hilarious! She ignored “ex” text. Here’s I made mistake. I texted ex 12:00 saying “don’t ignore me, come over.” She didn’t reply ex texted incredibly strange heard now live girlfriend, didn’t sound anything say. The next morning, looked contact card thought something looked odd, messaged Instagram asked lost phone, messages getting phone. He confirms number phone never phone number. That’s figured me. She furious accused many things trying manipulate making look pathetic idiot ex. She “he never believe I wasn’t making story talk since I saw store!” She considering ending relationship I betrayed trust. I really thought find funny. I joke! I feel dumb now really funny I little send messages I planned, caught quickly. At point I feel concerned ex’s perception state relationship, it’s making think prank idea may lead us reason. Do think I’m TA belong streets?
