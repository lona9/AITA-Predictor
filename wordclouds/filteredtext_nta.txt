It never really came ever point discussion, though come I've made lunch/dinner always dishes. I've never tried actively hide him. When asked I'd say things "burgers" I assumed knew naturally something impossible burgers. For Christmas neither us afford travel home neither close families Christmas apartment I cooked dinner, vegan lasagna. After dinner watching cooking show contestant making something fake meat.

He grew camping hiking often. I, hand, not. I think I went camping I little kid sat grandma’s RV pouting entire time. My boyfriend I now dating 6 months little “anniversary” present, boyfriend wanted take favorite hiking spot. We live warmer state, hiking isn’t abnormal. I little nervous it, agreed I definitely see person I’m gonna marry, means adapting lifestyle well. So went sunrise hike mountain little hour away us. The hike 3 miles total wasn’t difficult beginners. Before going, boyfriend gave safety run pushed I drink ton water. When trailhead, I needed pee slightly mentioned boyfriend finding bathroom beginning trailhead (which I believed around little hill) brushed though suggested going don’t miss beautiful part sunrise, I agreed. During first half hike, boyfriend kept pushing drink water point I felt I gonna throw (and bladder gonna explode). When best part hike, sat minutes I mentioned heading back point I reallyyyyy needed find bathroom. My boyfriend insisted stay minutes I finally dragged up. Listen, I’ve never peed outside entire life. But I must’ve drank much water bladder couldn’t take it. Before even made back down, I knew I pee pants. I kept mentioning boyfriend kept comforting me, saying okay, saying I can make it. Unfortunately, I make it. I apologized profusely I duck behind big rock little ways trailhead pee I going pee pants. He angry, scoffed huffed I asked stand watch, instead stood trail, angry ever. And make matters worse, older couple cutting brush walked right me, didn’t say anything. So yeah, boyfriend understandably furious me, exposing hike, also rushing beautiful view. This favorite hiking spot I ruined it. I feel terrible, I also feel something I couldn’t control. AITA? TL:DR Peed outside first boyfriend favorite hiking trail now he’s furious can’t ever go back there. Edit: I will breaking Here's situation; I m27 girlfriend f24 7 months. We live together sleep-overs place regularly. 2 days-ago, She spent night place morning I sleeping up, dressed, took credit-Card went grocery shopping it.

She collected stuff left spent effort prepare break-fast I line say stole forgot wallet home. She kept hanging I tried calling later sent money stuff bought although take anything her. My sister came I called ungrateful jerk manners react way display affection girlfriend. She suggested I apologize soo possible I decided take time. AITA? Me [F34] And husband [M33] live 2 bedr apartment. He started recently attending online therapy. Reasons? No reason particular. losing family member, recent traumas accidents says feels overwhelmed work (he works demanding job I mention I judged it) wanted let steam attend therapy. I 100% encouraged 'go it. However therapy sessions happening period 3 months. And 2 sessions day. He says found another therapist which's illogical anyway. stay bedroom hours end preventing coming in. I'm talking 3 4 hrs day Whenever I walk bedroom twice laptop gets slammed shut husband stare confused. I pointed rude therapist(s) agressively replied really rude way I barge trying therapy session. He I walk will take matters hands. Yesterday I emergency inside bedroom pad pack I keep closet. I kept knocking answer I walk quietly immediately shuts laptop looks enraged says "oh doin' this???

I take laptop really go anywhere else wether apartment, coffeshop, car even parking lot! He shamed apartment I negative disrespectful instead supportive understanding situation We've arguing hours til now. Now I'm leaving you. Am wrong asking that?. Edit# One I'd clarify everyday multiple days week. And two guessed work I agree use therapy I supported first started also suggested room since private person issues opening whatever struggle dealing with. Still thinks I'm helping causing stress anxiety. I f25 moved away town husband's m32 hometown married. The main reason suffers medical chronic condition needs near family. I pregnant first baby nearing due date husband travel town work 2 weeks. Because delivery room expected. I wanted ask mom come assured family help I worried. He made promise I let anyone see son first person besides stepmom supposed I agreed. His stepmom I went labor stayed away since type involved keeps distance. She's also "I diapers" type meaning offer help baby I expecting it. She dropped son home asked I call emergency. I felt helpless I asked neighbor favors needed real help baby I called mom (she new I'd given birth) asked come help drove 4 hours come stay me. She helped tremendously I'm grateful that. My husband stayed away days came home. Once saw mom upset repeatedly saying I broke promise I made letting others meet son I explained I needed help brought stepmom I replied dropped left it. Besides, mom good terms I mad met grandbaby inevitable. He mom since could've anybody else disrespecting wishes breaking promise I made. He reminded also parent gets say too. point I overreacting replied I forever tainted memory son's birth broke trust proved word "is worth shit" now. Mom tried give us space I nothing wrong came help stepmom left I blamed asking help. He stop giving excuses admit I wronged I started avoiding kept focusing attention son. He keeps acting cold towards calling selfish promise breaker expecting make him. wanted apology I given yet. AITA? Eta We talk phone several times already knew stepmom refused stay call something happens I tell calling mom knowing react decided wait til home talk it.[removed]Hi everyone. On Mobile. Merry Christmas! First things first, I (24F) dating “Kyle” (25M) two months now. He started spend night. Kyle never grew pets, cat “adjustment” (his words). My cat “Crumb” (4M) important aspect life right now. Like cat parents, rules household. We close, since I found abandoned side road (as 3mo old kitten) nursed back health. Crumb docile, hasn’t shown affection really interest Kyle. I don’t force it. Crumb does. Lately, Kyle complaining Crumb. I guess walked bathroom see Crumb rubbing face toothbrush (I electric ones stands). He shocked disgusting was. I laughed “yeah that’s great.” He demanded I new toothbrush (expensive) I no. I put toothbrush drawer. Next, Kyle says doesn’t nightly routine Crumb. I give Crumb kiss head, stomach face goes sleep. He sleeps bedside table cat bed. If I don’t routine, lays I do. I that’s annoying, that’s always I love it. Well Kyle says I unhygienic this. He says Crumb dirty (he inside I brush every day) even letting sleep bedroom gross gets fur everywhere (it doesn’t, Kyle isn’t even allergic so). I I put toothbrush away, I took joke didn’t punish Crumb. I tried explain can’t punish cats (nor I scenario), wouldn’t hear it. He went say kissing Crumb disgusting, especially face, wouldn’t ever kiss I kissed Crumb again. He asked put Crumb outside room over, lock “crate.” So I said, “okay bye.” Not Crumb 10000x important me, I laughed Kyle’s face never kissing cat again/keeping locked. This I may AH. Kyle I ruining future mean I laughing concerns. I felt guilty I asked group friends split. The pet owners laughed, non-pet owners I wrong making Kyle feel comfortable. They Kyle wasn’t asking rid Crumb, compromise him. They I kinda gross understand concerns. TLDR; Bf doesn’t kissing cat. I wasn’t going stop laughed him. He friends call insensitive gross.

Whenever I gently brought responded "I'm trying figure next move. Stop pressuring me." Not long pregnant son, still young pregnant daughter. A months born I asked wife plans job-wise finally "I go back work. You make enough us by. Just let wife mother."

However, money WAY tighter I'd like. We barely saving anything I'm even able meet employer's match 401K order enough us by. We living lean; eating beans rice dinner couple times week, etc. I feel I signed this. We working married I never thought live income.

She parents called house, telling disappointed supporting sister's relationship Ben. They brought fact cancer teenager, never learned proper social etiquette, hard meeting people. I buy this, part I've seen socialize fine since spent good chunk sick together, also mean I bad social skills well, logic. They I accept sister Ben's relationship, may go contact me. I reminded I'm also daughter understand point view, adamant jealous her. For record: I'm jealous her. I'm upset Ben picked me. I'm sad end relationship feel betrayed, lord knows I cheater.

But I think abdication parent's responsibilities wrong me, many pointed out. I definitely lot think about. Thank making feel less crazy this! &#x200B; &#x200B; UPDATE: Sometimes can laugh. Just phone cousin saw post explain things. I asked Reddit instead school, asked I Reddit instead work, I touché. He conversation mom, went house talked aunt.

And start thinking fuck I'm going do.Recently I (25m) engaged amazing fiancee (24f) Amy. I happiest I ever Amy yes nothing excited wedding. We started planning venues, dates invites. When talking invite, agreed invite coworkers worked respective jobs years all. As I checked list, Amy spoke everyone job can come except work friend Tally (26f). Tally also close friends surprised Amy invite her. She met Tally multiple times seem issues. When I asked why, finds friendship uncomfortable, saying thinks Tally type person try sway taken men center attention. After talking see idea, turned based nothing Tally's looks even Amy admitted Tally always kind her. But still, Amy adamant Tally going makes insecure. Amy beautiful woman I dont feels way. I Amy makes feel comfortable Tally wedding fine, BUT invitations go I wanted speak privately let save embarrassment. Amy agreed really that, speak matter after. A week later went work Tally started ignore me, really talking work related. I confused isnt her, coworkers started ignore acting strange me. So I contacted bf, sarcastic phone. I asked problem asked I actually didnt happened. He filled in. Turned days earlier Amy came work day invitations (I idea even made yet) handed everyone invite front Tally, saying Tally "you invited, women welcome" sparked everyone suggesting "other woman". Since harassed guys work shunned women. She now looking another job. This pissed I apologised profusely I know. When I home night I confronted Amy this. She denied first, now issue quitting job. I flipped saying clearly didnt trust say crossed line behind back. She see problem upset asking I'm mad, responding "if really going married, insecurities check grow up". I stayed friends since texts Amy, friends mother saying I asshole Amy deserve treatment. AITA? Edit: I explained better 2 things: 1. I made many attempts speak Tally privately find happening prior contacting bf. She brushed saying either work nothing talk about. No really speak I contacted bf last resort. Her bf says going pass onto Tally I phone. 2. The wedding currently hold, also I'm staying friends. Need distance figure stuff out. I made post texts. Edit 2: Jesus blew up, I must say thank everyone advice giving me. But thing I must clear up.... whole suggestion I may cheated Amy Tally. All I can ask can people opposite sex friends without anything untoward happening? Nothing ever will happen Tally, feelings, nothing adult, absolutely nothing! Tally happy inlove, boyfriend someone I also consider close friend, I happy Amy (prior this) Tally sister me. I find pretty disturbing people even suggesting I something Tally. Ask this, gods green earth I let encourage Amy meet Tally first place anything happened? That messed beyond belief. Also I work office. I idea people getting idea since I never industry I work in. I work retail chain... nothing special. Questions: 1. What I planning Tally? Unfortunately due Amy done, I can really damage control. Of course I planning explain everyone happened, I Tally going this. She genuinely kind person deserve this. I actually way speak boss moment see can done. Tally's boyfriend also saying will speak behalf see can talk me. Hopefully will update tomorrow.I’m 27 old male grandmother passed recently. In will left 4 bedroom 2 bath house.

My wife less conventionally attractive I fell love humour good spirit I personally find attractive good looks. Recently I've noticed wife making lot comments Rachel calling airhead kind mean. When wife makes comments private Im able stand Rachel made public I obviously embarrass wife calling out. My wife I went trip away Matt Rachel last week planning really looking forward to. At dinner night wife made really mean comment started talking economy. She remarked worry Rachel can join conversation smart people done. She laughed. I completely embarrassed alone I wife really rude I ashamed her. I needs stop making nasty comments agreed. However next night went bar. Rachel getting lot attention guys sending drinks. My wife looking visibly annoyed receiving attention I tried lift spirits paying drinks making fuss her. One guy came Rachel looked model zendaya. My wife let massive laugh mean say Whoopi Goldberg. I turned wife straight really jealous you. She looked hurt respond Rachel left table tears. I followed Matt Rachel directly I sorry wife's words I ashamed behaviour. When I reunited wife I horrible calling jealous infront everyone embarrassing her. I straight jealous Rachel Rachel attractive her. I realise hindsight heavy thing say can see hurt it. However I stand fact anger. AITA? Edit: I forgot mention since trip Matt messaged let wife longer welcome wedding couple Rachel decided interested friendship anymore wife around. Rachel feels wife bullied even suggested comments racially motivated. I humiliated. Edit: Sorry another edit. Just wanted clarify wife stunning. I married I think beautiful. She CONVENTIONALLY attractive. To beautiful women planet objectively Rachel better looking. I'm open asshole situation I definitely people think I'm attracted wife. Update: Thanks feedback guys. Just add although I call wife public I regularly called private make comments. The reason continued hang group wife reassured Rachel well comments good spirit. Matt also continue invite us I think much problem. Also regards free drinks Rachel accepted table. We shared drinks joking around. The drinks sent two creepy guys whole bar buying Rachel drinks. Matt insecure rather accept free alcohol haha. Also wife earns split costs 50/50 time. I payed drinks make feel better. Before I update I also make clear I feelings Rachel. I think conventionally attractive girl model. I'm even really friends Rachel pointed younger much common. I also make clear wife conventionally attractive also less Rachel. Rachel model. My wife not. This mean I think wife attractive Rachel me. I mean objectively Rachel better looking. I agree comments wife I assholes situation. My wife's behaviour unacceptable mine cruel probably done lasting damage wife's self-esteem. I think I'm asshole failing call wife sooner. In opinion never publically criticise partner telling privately jokes inappropriate enough. I also point wife I already couples counseling wife individual therapy. When I initially made comment Rachel attractive wife furious rightly so. She cruel thing say jealous Rachel insisted jokes offensive everyone tiptoeing round pretty girl. When returned home trip I received Matt's message I let wife know. At first hurt eventually came around behaviour inappropriate. She's admitted jealous Rachel due looks embarrassed behaviour. I also asked felt I found Rachel attractive think difficult seeing younger prettier girl treated way better felt second best. I think wife noticed Rachel getting special treatment people jealous receive same. My wife sent apology Rachel I think friendship salvageable.

They're uncomfortable, constricting, expensive. With work home, I spent last half basically never wearing bra used it. Quite frankly, boobs nonexistent anyways. I recently started going gym started working braless. I note now, ever pointed anything wrong wearing bra. However, middle set squats (yes, MID SQUAT), guy comes me, taps shoulder attention, tells nipples poking shirt. I really irritated tf guy staring nipples first place stopping mid-set inform me?

I'm really fucking pissed point I need help finishing set fuck looking chest first place?? He going spot me, noticed chest thought it'd inappropriate. I pointed safety bar set, even I fail set, needed. But insisted people gyms look other, going forward, I probably wear bra people uncomfortable may help stay balanced squats. I'm literally girl weights section gym moment, guys squatting failed sets never worry shit. I've seen guys fail multiple sets row ever rushes aid, I slight pause, everyone thinks I need rescuing. So I'm now really annoyed also kind uncomfortable guy I've never spoken life thinks helping audacity tell dress. So I tell "You bigger boobs nipples I do. Maybe YOU wear bra people uncomfortable fail squats." He really defensive, saying trying help, called bitch. Honestly I'm sure I overreacted, I'm still kind pissed maybe clouding judgment. AITA? Edit add: I'm sure people think I'm walking around extremely obvious nipples showing. I actually really hate constricting clothes.

Soup chosen can feed large amount people lot cash. Money tight, I'm sure many people right now. If low cost alternative suggestion, please let know! Thanks judgements** So first little background. I found young age (~3 months) youngest allergic dairy eggs. After bunch testing determined can’t dairy eggs form, even cooked/baked. On issue. Her first birthday next weekend. From go I wanted birthday completely safe her. As in, food, drink, desserts, etc will egg dairy free. We spent much figuring allergic avoiding it, I wanted day monitor everything ate. And course baby, tends grab anything wants, allergens means I don’t worry children (6f, 3m) leaves food reach. This becoming problem now husband doesn’t ‘only vegan food’ says side family won’t eat it. I wasn’t planning anything there. My mom volunteered make homemade veggie soup, I going make chocolate cake frosting. The difference normal cake frosting I’m making apple sauce instead eggs oat milk instead cows milk. My nephews husbands side won’t eat soup I guess, neither will parents. The boys I think liked cake, soon in-laws discovered ‘vegan’ won’t eat vegan food, neither will kids. My husband wants pizza ‘normal’ cake it’s like. I don’t understand point birthday meal birthday kid can’t even eat. I didn’t think much ask day catered daughter, she’s going spend rest life working around everyone else. AITA? **ETA - I problem making foods including meat, already everyone this. I tend default saying vegan instead “egg-free dairy-free” it’s faster, bad. I’ve found options food contain meat, still allergen free I hope will make everyone happy.** **One edit - I didn’t realize soup considered weird. 😂 We live California, family I born raised Germany.

This actually made cry I’m rethinking whether actually extreme. So, Reddit, AITA For background info I (18) Asian American boyfriend (20) white. A couple days ago, messing around I “one friends call boyfriend Mayo packet, that’s next nickname?” In joking way, he’ll start calling ch*nk degrading manner. He thought funny, I upset he’s ignorant word known slur. He I shouldn’t called Mayo packet then. I I don’t think two words level offense, called hypocrite. For info, make stereotypical jokes time. He I’m dog eater mustard skin!!! But never knew good comeback. I recently heard term Mayo packet friend, thought level jokes made. (It childish me) But obviously hurted wasn’t intention. (And according Redditors term slur. I idea.) And never called term ch*nk before. I apologized realizing sooner found term offensive calling it, I normalized racism onto him. I asked stop calling ch*nk term now on. He see problem ch*nk, repeating I apparently deserve it. *We haven’t talked days, I’ve avoiding confrontation part still angry situation part I still relationship I afraid I resume argument, we’d break up.* Edit: might familiar term, explanation. It new trend among gen Z create terms insult caucasians way POC slurs used. He heard term friends, joked around word regular I’ve noticed found humorous (his friends aren’t white either). I wouldn’t something lightly I knew found insulting. This first I’ve brought up, seems I assumed he’s fine it’s okay. I agree problematic. Edit 2: I usually find jokes racially stereotypes funny. I don’t mind people saying I eat rice I’m fresh boat. People call things time, even boyfriend make jokes towards me. I suppose I normalized them.I didn’t line I crossed it. Edit 3: edited original post clarity. Edit 4: You guys right, shouldn’t thing first place. It’s problematic, slur not. But going long him, even dated made jokes toward me. I guess thought I came say I’m okay sudden I’ve let gone long ideal. I’m sure do. Edit 5: y’all need stop saying I think it’s okay say something racist white ppl away cuz they’re white. I think can racist anyone… I agree I part problem. Please please please stop using post excuse say “white people bad”.This throwaway friends Reddit I find this.

My husband I (both early 30s) together decade made decision kids. I kids, I nieces nephews, reasons. He vasectomy people about. Our families aware kids asked different major life events (our wedding instance). We recently bought 3 bedroom home nice yard nice area. Excited show new home family friends (major upgrade previous home), hosted housewarming. During party, sibling laws (Alex) made indirect comments space, kids love house etc. Eventually asked point blank kids. I made lighthearted joke it, go-to question. "Oh, well, I sushi much give pregnancy. Plus drinking pregnancy breastfeeding? No thanks!" I tried make light hearted laugh off. Most people laughed along. That seemed anger Alex I "children joy, good mother puts kids everything else". I agreed, 'children joy, I spending nieces nephews, obviously I good mom I chose sushi kids I mom' (paraphrased). Still trying brush gentle way I'm trying start fight telling stop asking front everyone I tone will seen rude abrasive. We move on, Alex still annoyed making little comments group flippant I finally happens, I'll understand. My husband heard jokingly "well, gets pregnant, that'll problem divorce lawyers." That seemed piss stopped. With holidays coming up, invited Alex's usual Halloween bonfire. When husband spoke parents, Alex annoyed careless callous childfree status say realized taken permanent steps ensure never kids. That IF kids etc. And AHs care. I feel bad IF lots fertility treatments kids, even still miscarriages. I imagine wanting kids struggling deal miscarriages. But time, I'm tired justifying living life I want. AITA? Edited add: To people messaging commenting AH wanting kids: I'm asking I'm AH kid decision, I'm asking I'm AH saying sushi kids comment. To everyone else: holy guacamole, I'm overwhelmed. I never expected many responses. I trying read advice given. I feel terrible joke taken way I hurt ILs, I truly never meant happen. After bonfire weekend, will reaching heart heart, accept it.

AITA?I'm really photographer, I'm dog groomer. I take lots photos dogs day put Facebook Instagram, "my thing" makes sense. A cut photo every appointment. I seldom shoot things dogs even I nice set up. A friend married days ago wanting save money, asked I'd shoot them. I really forte convinced saying care perfect: shoestring budget I agreed shoot $250, nothing 10 hour event. On day of, I'm driving around following bride goes appointment appointment ceremony, taking photos along way. I shoot ceremony itself, reception I'm shooting speeches people mingling. I started around 11am due finish around 7:30pm. Around 5pm, food served I I stop eat I need photographer; fact, save spot table. I'm getting tired point kinda regretting next nothing. It's also unbelievably hot: venue old veteran's legion 110F AC. I groom I need take 20min something eat drink. There's open bar anything, I even water two water bottles long empty. He tells I need either photographer, leave without pay. With heat, hungry, generally annoyed circumstances, I asked sure, yes, I deleted photos I took front took saying I'm photographer anymore. If I paid $250, honestly point I paid $250 glass cold water somewhere sit 5min. Was I asshole? They went right honeymoon social media, lot people posting wall asking photos zero responses.Context: My mother came bi younger disowned parents started dating women. My grandmother came back life mother older sister me. My sister caught quicker chose disassociate her. I younger know. Due I named sole inheritor everything grandmother owned, including house. My grandmothers final spiteful move mother seems. &#x200B; I (f18) recently started college scholarship included living campus. I thought good idea comfort zone level independence. &#x200B; My sisters best friend 'Jen' (21f) recently disowned family outed spent thanksgiving us/staying us. Obviously mother taken Jen in. The day thanksgiving mum Jen will permanently moving in. Both sister go school 30 minutes away convenient. My mum going give Jen room convenient sister share room. &#x200B; Up point I board felt bad I problem this. We 3/4 bedroom house, fourth currently used storage room. I think fair displaced room can move into. The stuff inside can easily moved closets around house big room. My mother argued I go school 6 hours away will home couple weeks selfish keep room. Jen also likes fact room balcony stated liked level everyone else/felt isolated sleeping ground floor. I prioritising someone else child I say I'd never discriminated based sexuality disowned it. I I felt disowning right now bedroom Jen move room. &#x200B; Next day rolls around Jen starts thanking letting move room starts talking redecorating, painting etc. I'm confused tell happening bedroom downstairs wanted move in. My mum sister angry I getting overwhelmed shouted 'I let kick home. That bedroom will continue bedroom. If choose Jen me, go live another house family there.' Apparently now I've made Jen feel unwelcome thinks I hate sexuality. My mum sister keep making comments 'inhospitable' 'can't believe pulled 'I house' even though pay bills'. &#x200B; I paid tax house inheritance money live grandmothers house. Some important context: My father left I 10, I came home school day gone I alone. My grandmother eventually took moment gave issues I'm still working through. My grandmother passed away buried couple weeks ago. I saw father first 14 years mother's funeral. After will read, learnt grandmother left property.

My father going around telling family I stole mother's property right I'm trying punish leaving me. My family reaching tell even abandoned I forget importance filial piety good father even good makes good daughter. I think I'm anything wrong comments suggestions beginning wear down. Am I asshole?My partner I first child (yay) I stupidly made deal name child boy, I name girl (I know, I f'd up). Well, boy names partner coming are...not me. I managed convince forget deal made least element gone BUT still mean seem little say I situation. Anyway, name really eager use 'Black'. We something bit different without hippy-dippy outcome. Their reasoning something along lines of: colours names already thing (e.g. Violet, Blue) black cool colour. They think sounds cool really. However, I think bit odd white. It seems like, yeah colour, - race race pretty sensitive topic. They think crazy logic, nothing race making race absurd. FWIW American race huge deal there. Just clarify - will name child anything agree on, convo now become whether name colour something charged neither us can really see others perspective.

I found vacation family things I interest participating times I stayed behind. He let borrow laptop I left mine home. I made folder name I searching I found another folder name. The folder full reports me, family (including extended family) two childhood friends. I read much reports I husband family came home day. At first, I hurt something without talking first I read started finding things family friends I never even knew, I started angry. It’s hard put words I felt I gone cold also wasn’t reading things. So, I saw husband, I exploded front family. At first, tried say wasn’t big deal cousin chimed say normal wasn’t done family. When saw I wasn’t calming tried go room talk privately I I wasn’t going anywhere I leaving. My husband stay sleep somewhere else leave staying house owned parents felt weird stay make leave, especially since family still too.

I inherited parents' house died decade ago since wife kids living apartment, decided easiest moved house married. The kids now rooms, yard play in, dog, really nice.

My solution kids go back sharing room MIL gets bedroom. My wife kids gotten used space force give up. I asked ok give space, anyone else? I I gaining nothing MIL move in.

My wife getting hostile towards relationship suffering. Do I need bite bullet give space? I think I'm already giving lot allowing MIL move us, I asshole this?[removed] I’m pregnant twins fiancé I found we’re boy girl. We started talking names day. He really wanted name boy baby (first middle). I wasn’t onboard first thinking I agreed. I girl baby I wanted first name sister’s since we’re close middle dads since passed I young. (My dads name isn’t really unisex it’s becoming common girl’s name). My fiancé visibly sad wanted name girl baby mom middle name dads name (his dads name IS unisex name). I I didn’t really think fair name first baby wanted now wants name second baby also wants. I also wasn’t fair family gets excluded. He really wanted incorporate least moms name. I girl baby’s middle name can mom’s boy’s middle name going dads. He wanted boy baby named completely though baby Junior. I doesn’t name babies wants. He upset comment stand offish toward me. I don’t think awful say now I’m second guessing comment wondering I’m asshole it. Edit: I feel I need clear something I’m seeing lot. Quite lot people keep telling give kids original names name someone else. In family it’s normal recycle names name new babies family members. It’s actually considered abnormal give baby “original” name. I isn’t norm it’s weird others I said, it’s normal us family actually loves recycled names. A us love names, don’t find weird enjoy it. Every family different families enjoy sharing names, it’s fine don’t agree that’s family is. Edit #2: UPDATE Okay so, lot decompress here. First wanted say sorry comments going unanswered, I trying keep many haha. Thank everyone took day help I appreciate it! Now onto actual update, fiancé I talked long I even showed post. He apologized acted, always wanted children excited naming babies. He didn’t mean come selfish didn’t mean exclude family excited I right wasn’t fair sulk getting name babies. And knows doesn’t name both, moron (his words mine). I never wanted use “I’m growing 9 months going labor” card I felt unfair lot people suggested I bring I end pointing him. He knew appreciated going hard work obviously I able input name suggestions. He also hadn’t thought repercussions Junior (same first, middle last name) financial issues issues paperwork. So decided junior! Thank pointed me. (And also thank hilarious pointed I calling son’s name sex hahah) So decided boy baby’s middle name will fiancé’s dad’s name girl baby’s middle name will sister’s name. As first names decided use different variation family member’s names (which again, people suggested thank you) So boy baby will named fiancé’s mother will different variation name Stephanie Steven Harriet Harry. For girl baby will named dad different variation James Jane Daniel Danielle. This way babies mix family’s names family’s names favoritism families I keep tradition using family names (just little different) without headache deal paperwork baby named family member. Thank everyone put suggestions gave advice! And also sorry I don’t respond comments I don’t think I’m going use reddit cause mods. Thanks everyone! :)Today I took 3 month old twins supermarket wife day (she stay home I working lot due holidays) While shopping daughter pooped, I mean POOPED. There’s changing tables men’s room family bathroom. I went Starbucks store asked I change tables back (I blanket changing pad bag, ass wouldn’t bare table) The barista yes I business. An older woman, probably late 40’s early 50’s came started talking son I baby wearing back. He’s cute I didn’t pay mind. She started telling I needed make sure wipe “little tookie” referring privates. I I well aware change diaper, continued critique (best word I can use) wiping style eventually I went change clothes due baby poop blowout I putting dirty clothes waste bag, woman goes put clothes her. I snatched daughter table woman “I don’t need someone else dressing baby, go away creep.” The woman looked flabbergasted started crying saying trying help. Pretty much everyone surrounding area reaction trying assist me. I feel bad snapping her. My wife done thing, I feel douche bag. AITA? Edit: I comment asking I will put I go car change I car. I walked store 5 minute walk, I going make baby sit poop I finished shopping. Final edit: I changed baby table I wasn’t going allow infant sit shit I put groceries back walked home. I realize changing table best idea, option. I change floor men’s room baby still me, store manager alright will sanitize soon I done. I also think ask use women’s changing station. I recognize I, 6’7 male, intimidating even two babies I thought issue. In future I will make sure ask, thank everyone suggested it. Just add, I didn’t ask I asshole changing daughter table, I don’t particularly care think I am. I asked I asshole I responded woman. Thank you.

I shocked I asked far I allergic vegan even tried mom's cooking. She choice wanted eat something else add new flavor thanksgiving since always forced eat old traditional meals every family.

I made excuse fiancee come I'm still bothered happened especially keeos guilting leaving behind calling selfish jerk whatnot. ETA: Oh yeah, She actually planning bringing entire cooked meal I talking side dishes share family. would've different story. Me F27 Phil M32 married 3yrs. We families first everything. Phil read article boundaries encouraged set boundaries families, I agreed made progress. As birth son approached handled families requests~ Both moms wanted room no, Both dads wanted first photo baby til agree, Both families wanted hospital see son agreed host gathering Tuesday families see son first time. pics, posts video calls til since I needed recover. Everything going well started Phil secretly took picture son sent family. It blew up, everyone tagged everyone FB Mom family saw picture posts inlaws made saying "we won end" "our grandson chose us" "1-0". MIL lied taking picture hospital. Mom called crying saying Phil leaked shared pic son violated agteement families had. Dad top defeat deal propaganda emotional stress inlaws. I fuming I asked Phil sent family picture son hours ago. He (jokingly) - ummm...yesn't. I blew saying agreement family respected family OTOH humiliating family, ruining joy rubbing fact first see son face. He what? family quit overdramatic "shit" go way. I family ones overdramatic, passive, aggressive attitude. I showed every post tag made asked happy family this. He scrolled couple minutes nodding n' looking impressed. He innocently sent mom picture since stop calling, hassling begging picture - I still violated agreement share photos til tuesday way family will never respect boundaries ~"try"~ set. I asked "boundaries" family keep arms length obviously favoring his. He - son I aurhority send picture whomever I please, okay! Your family?...the entire lot can either STEFU wait sister "miraculously" give baby. We argued I refused drop it. I overreacted, blew joy, made big deal Just cause family nothing better cry "woe me" wrapped saying I clearly enmenshed, deep fog needed cut damn cord already. I'm thinking I might've harsh. AITA? Context; Phil best relationship family. He thinks controlling trys exclude events letting family involved everything. He's always home due work local PD (Police Department) still controls events family should/shouldn't attend. Also, sister infertile way Phil "miraculously" hurt behalf.[removed]My husband M35 bank clerk I F29 WFH job I barely bear since I'm active outdoor person gardening stuff particular. I figured since I background gardening I decided use spacious backyard grow flowers sell online arranging organizing bouqets. When I brought husband worst idea ever, adding major waste money suggested I look 2nd job. I listen started business little little. In matter 18 months started bringing decent money I gained customers. My husband offered look much I able make past months impressed. The day standing drink I checking flowers. He talked good job I keeping "our" business "flowing". I corrected business reminded little faith potential make decent money growing, selling cut flowers. He "Well...I honestly think little gardening hobby going anywhere now business "flourishing" I fair share profit settle less 50%" I puzzled I asked thought share profit let alone 50%. His answer I using soil grow flowers on. I house/our soil since married names title. He "actually I owned house long came along technically mine!" I replied must aware it'll split half case seperation. He laughed joked silly I "hinting" seperation asking something richly deserves 50% profit. I delusional ask cause even soil alone magically grow flowers lot work picking, buying seeds, taking time, effort care them. Collecting, triming, selling sit back. I matter I started using "his soil" now? He always matters money involved!. We argument apologized BUT ONLY approaching subject rudely still wants 50%. He's silent since stating already needed say I needed make right decision. AITA? To clarify husband I salaries, contribute equally towards expenses. It's idea since divorce before. He still things owns alone bad since money never issue. It's needs money emergency something wants 50% profit going forward.I (35 M) working gym I'm resting in-between workouts I play mobile game.

On occasion I followed went upstairs (i going something child bedrooms upstairs) walked past bathroom main floor stairs behind it. She didn’t hear I caught walking straight room rifling bills dresser. She denied snooping (even though I’d watched it) going use bathroom couldn’t find ones. She walked right past main floor another upstairs hallway go bedroom. Since happened, I installed exterior doorknob requires key bedroom door door office/spare bedroom. However, she’s still always “forgetting” bathroom trying bedroom office door. This really ticks off. My husband says I annoyed everything drives crazy since we’ve put locks rooms don’t in, isn’t really problem anymore. Well holidays laws dinner came I searching bedroom keys. We hadn’t used since lock doors MIL comes over. My husband didn’t need lock doors since wouldn’t try rooms I insisted loves snoop. We went back forth decided cover doorknobs super fine glitter see tried them. I husband didn’t believe snooping prove she’d rooms. Last ignored glitter didn’t say anything husband couldn’t deny she’d tried snoop. So I covered knobs glitter office went touch rigged little folder glitter door office laws came over. I left side unlocked (French doors) set walked room covered glitter. Husband goes way show mom main floor bathroom specifically asks parents sister go upstairs. There’s baby gate kids can’t upstairs either. Well guess go bathroom covered glitter hands hair? She completely lost started screaming I yelled back now husband saying I went far I’m asshole. MIL also says I’m asshole SIL says I didn’t anything wrong MIL deserved snooping. FIL Switzerland. Apparently car ruined now it’s covered glitter cant cleaned up. So AITA? ETA: I can’t believe blew I wanted say thank support awards! My husband woke found post I think comments eye opener. We going start couple’s therapy January I think will great us. I will ordering cellulose glitter biodegradable safer future projects. And comes I will set camera haha least print fun fake documents snoops can least find something interesting :)I believe spilt opinion office, go. A co-worker mine (39F) recently twin boys long battle infertility. She made first appearance office new babies introduce team. When asked named boys (as appearance undecided) naming "Sean". When I asked baby, "no, Sean, "A" "E" Sean Seen". This co-workers last name also "Sean". When I pointed "yes, Tom Tom Jay Jay". I immediately without thinking "that idiotic thing I've heard, going confusing". A bunch people laughed bunch immediately looked away. After left, I text messages saying place comment people's choice name. Am I asshole saying terrible naming idea? Edit. Additional information. No, middle names, wanted names "Tom Tom, Jay Jay". This apparently first round negative feedback had. We good terms, worked together across three companies 12 years, "it'll grow you". The names pronounced "Sean" "Shawn". **EDIT AND UPDATE** My co-workers husband (who also co-worker) saw post last night. They good chuckle ended agreeing replies naming process ideal, maybe overwhelming process two new borns left tired think straight. Despite fact already sent paperwork birth deaths marriages office (the place lodge births Australia), called Brisbane office paperwork provisionally processed (due Xmas time), used reassess. They withdrawn paperwork **(FOR SEEN ONLY)** will think new name, keeping Sean Sean it. I also reported HR making reddit post (not parents, think hilarious) well well, consequences actions. They also everyone "calling idiot worst thing I've year, I'll definitely AH, general thing tied situation". Happy holidays everyone. **Final update:** A lot people wanted update post meeting HR whatever reason is, expected underwhelming. Met HR yesterday (10th), meeting pretty brief definitely waste everyone's time. They asked I aware company's social media policy. I I was, I fairly confident I breached it. They agreed I hadn't, asked "to considerate co-workers feelings" "not put meeting internet". I "I'll definitely update" "I'll sure call next person naming child Seen Sean idiotic". Again, I work banking long way go fixing culture across every banking organisation I think HR thing, making sure I'm notice case I... I dunno take photo stealing candy baby wearing company logo something.Okay, fiancé (both 28) invited parents dinner place. I cooked meal (not simple extravagant I amazing cook) ready arrived.

Instead started laughing saying something “oh yeah, don’t worry. married things will different.” And me. I didn’t make scene I waited left talk fiancé. I I mad laughing comment instead saying ir changing topic. He I overreacting way dad jokes. I I didn’t find “joke” funny. He pissed talk I’ve calmed down. AITA? I realized I made mistake, I don’t son. On part FIL says comment I wrote “to son”. I going write “my fiancé” mixed “his son”. —— Edit: This update, anyone wonders: https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive_Path_715/comments/td0gmz/update_on_my_situation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfI(29f) work waitress restaurant point system.

We I thought happy marriage husband's father passed away early 2021 (he received cancer diagnosis gone weeks later). My husband is, understandably, completely devastated - remained close father, despite longer following religious beliefs childhood. My husband decided honor father's memory rejoining church. Unfortunately, churches forbids many things I find fun relatively harmless classifies "addictions" "tools Satan." For example, father's passing husband I enjoyed glass wine cocktail now (maybe couple times week) also enjoyed weed edibles (legally) every month two. But joining church husband decided alcoholic drug addict. He also decided occasional porn use (we enjoyed together spice things now then) also "addiction." He now insisting I also addict I give things up. I tried meet halfway - I care weed fine never using again, agreed drink home husband truly wanted sober household, I still occasional drink friends. I will admit I (written) erotica, never thought problem became religious. He also threw away vibrator saying instrument Devil. The latest husband's pastor video games (all games, M rated ones) sinful now husband insisting I video game addiction need treatment. Gaming main hobby me, probably around 8-10 hours week. It's addiction view, something I really enjoy! I work full-time, cook, clean, exercise, etc. I'm neglecting anything else life (except respect husband's new beliefs, I guess) gaming. My husband wants start going church him. He says will go couples counseling church, secular counselor. I I understand grieving struggling I kind supportive, really helps can keep alcohol weed house, I going become evangelical (unlike him, I raised atheist parents) going restrict activities finds acceptable religious beliefs. I also asked please stop labeling habits "addiction." Of course now thinks I AH mean grieving. Most family members friends also think I asks name supportive. So, AITA?I've wife five years, married two old son. My mom type person change, new people, keeps herself. That controlling seem care kids lives, feels things pushed her. She also someone will keep without thinking, continued buy lavish gifts, nothing wife baby, I think malicious, hurt wife even marriage mom buying gifts. I sat mom explained this.

The sister cried finally blew wife I ruined Christmas ruined family left early. Her sister called mom later finally answer, begged "normal" Christmas again, mom feels now getting married kids "problem" anymore will think leaning towards me.

About 2-3 years ago development company bought bunch surrounding property build semi-gated community. The fence community ends good yards away property isn’t closed way. Now people moved I’ve getting HOA letters fees, lawn, house paint. I tried emailing HOA president never back me. I crashed last meeting explained house wasn’t part neighborhood therefore part HOA. The president board members tried say I close property is. It isn’t, I documentation development company county saying isn’t. After meeting president emailed back regardless particulars I still try conform rest community I bringing property values down. I I lucky getting home I don’t negatively affect others, especially considering current market. AITA listening HOA?My (26M) sister Maya (25F) engaged man middle eastern culture. We raised religion big ethnic customs. Her wedding set March 2022. I also save date college friends date different part country. Now normally it'd suck miss friend's wedding sister probably overrules friend. The thing is, wedding going custom fiancé's family, segregate based sexes allowing alcohol. Meaning I'd totally sober even allowed hang girlfriend. That sounds boring us. My friend's wedding "normal" American separations open bar. My girlfriend I pretty good friends bride groom will much fun. I Maya I'm comfortable setup wedding going go friend's instead super pissed me. I normal I'd go Im going spend money traveling hotel sober weird wedding even allowed dance gf I go good friend's wedding great instead. My parents kinda too. My dad I put gf first agrees wont nearly good time. My mom exactly thrilled culture Maya's marrying (it's sexist) sad I wont pictures, gets it. Maya however taken well keeps texting accusing bad brother Xenophobic..Thats accurate another culture allowed men women spend together weddings atleast drink I'd go weird. Right now Im leaving read I think say. \* When I say segregated, I mean seating eat. Its separate rooms entire event. Didn't expect big reaction. I'm going log now feeling pretty assured decision. Thank you[deleted]I’ve previous experience group I live neighborhood HOA I rest houses built formed group. I’m member anyway verified real estate attorney. So anyway apparently rule many lights can put earliest date can put up. The woman I deal I upset came 11/30 lights policy I allowed many lights I do. I I way beholden policies don’t care. I respect people neighborhood I I wasn’t going go full Clark Griswold house nieces nephews loved lights I putting fair amount. I also I didn’t care rules lights certain hours done putting 30th I likely turn leave till Christmas. She breaking rules upset members I respect rules even I don’t follow I technically live neighborhood. She offered flyer apparently rules lights. I tossed trash property. I probably could’ve entertained asked I’ve enough them.I (25f) daughter back October husband(30m). My husband grew mother SAHM father worked, wanted relationship. When I pregnant I still wfh majority reluctantly agreed keep working pregnant. We decided I'd stay employed 6 weeks paid maternity leave quit. &#x200B; I genuinely thought I wanted honestly awful. My husband works Law long hours, leaving alone handle everything around house top baby. I felt isolated overwhelmed felt I'd lost identity. I love mum I love daughter done eating, changing diaper etc sleep. I supposed age spending hours alone hard me. &#x200B; When I handed two weeks notice boss leave offered amazing job. I'd work part 2 days / 3 days rotating week. On top I'd go couple times month needed still partial benefits decent pay. I moon, I felt getting back work make feel myself. My husband pleased all. He argued that: * I agreed SAH married I pregnant. * I abandoning daughter 'why enough you?' * I'd dump childcare mom income cover childcare therefore worth it. I tried tell I feeling upset. He would've never married knew I raise child left friends place. He came back 2 days later talks baby related. Its nearly two weeks I I agreed years ago AITA changing mind? My MIL SIL raising family important job I ruin family I didn't. &#x200B; Edit: I send baby childcare right away. I simply brought permanent thing older concern. Also I'm going leave husband, child together I love him.I (29f) SAHM, I take care home son (4m) husband Sam (31m) works. I job four years Sam wanted SAHM son born. I accepted, since Sam absurdly good salary, mine great. My mom fell ill half ago. Her diabetes became quite complicated needed medical care. We live US, expenses relatively small. I asked Sam please give half total medical bill, since brother (25m) going pay half. Sam refused pay penny bill, since I income, brother pay all. Sadly, mom passed away month ago. My brother I whole estate order. Each us going somewhat considerable figure, since mother properties (which sell poor condition). This morning husband wants sell part inheritance, can make (non-vital) house repairs possibly go vacation. I laughed, anger anything else, right suggest make use inheritance mother left, refused even pay half medical bills. He called AH went work. I call sister, extremely angry. She called irrational since I living money Sam earns, I right demand money him, inheritance gives opportunity return money spent me. The call really thinking, now I wonder I'm really behaving AH. Edit: I've received lot comments asking questions, I will answer here. 1.- Why brother I received large inheritance helped mom treatment? My mom leave us cash, left us properties (4 total). This properties basically ruins, need ton work done, mom receive income properties. She placed two sale, never sold since real state market extremely expensive here. 2.- Why mom paid “main treatment”? My mom paid hospital entire treatment there, so, hospitalizacion larger procedure. My brother I wanted help medical appointments (she visited several especialists outside hospital) medicines (the hospital cover them). That's I expenses relatively small. Apologies redaction confusive. 3.- I made mistake commenting husbands earns five zeros, currency. Not dollars. He earns montly 12 thousand american dollars. I (22F) bf (25M) together 4 years. We started living together 2 years ago apartment it’s great! I recently new job make around $80k wanting apartment house. My bf hand doesn’t good work ethic 8 different jobs 4 years together, making minimum wage. I brought getting house totally board started house hunting. I enough savings payment cover closing cost boyfriend doesn’t saving lives paycheck paycheck. We currently split rent 50/50 pays bills (car payment, insurance, etc.) I pick groceries, wifi, dog stuff. I’m totally fine fact I pick expenses since I make he’s never complained. When looking house kept price range small enough I pay alone use earrings extra cash. But agreed split mortgage 50/50 (which cheaper current rent) I pay water, electric, home insurance, etc. We finally found dream house going signing papers couple weeks. I mentioned I name home since buying savings aren’t married don’t plan married anytime soon. He now upset bc it’s supposed “our house”. I’ve OUR house legally will mine bc I don’t put $400k line. He it’s going house shouldn’t pay live there. I disagree, paying rent anywhere else when/if married will change agreement. He hasn’t talked 3 days now I really don’t think I’m wrong here. So AITA?I (19F) boyfriend (25M) 6 months. We live together, I spend lot place. A week ago I feeling quite sick. Not wanting drive home, I spend night place. He woke 5 am, great embarrassment, I wet bed. I helped clean best I could. I temp 103.8 F took hospital, kept overnight. A days later I saw I apologised happened. He alright, gift. He pulled package adult diapers threw me. I I think funny explained I embarrassed, thought hilarious. I decided let go talk later. We went party night (not really 'party', us 6 friends), hour away. I drove, since car. After beers started loudly telling happened, 'forgetting' mention I sick high fever, part wetting bed buying diapers. He encouraged friends joke it, trying explain talked laughed at, I left went home. My boyfriend obviously quite upset I left without him, I stuck car hour. He sent several texts since then, calling sensitive 'not able take joke'. Some friends agree him. AITA?My (f26) fiancé (m28) together four years. He’s friends “maya” (f30) six years. They’re fairly close doesn’t much. It’s usually issue, people don’t mesh. We don’t mesh. Edit add: there’s heavy animosity can near fine, don’t talk are. We don’t actively hate other, prefer hang together. She isn’t us getting married likely say yes bridesmaid make happy isn’t pushing We’re recently engaged he’d bridesmaid. I don’t. He wants dress matching bridesmaids, side, participating things we’re doing. I absolutely not, doesn’t even me. I’ve seen wedding photos bridesmaid clearly doesn’t bride I don’t that. Plus I really women closest bridesmaids. I suggested wear black dress match men’s tux’s groomsman. He will look dumb doesn’t that. Because he’s dead set including side men activities I’m dead set bridesmaids, he’s I’ve effectively can’t wedding. I argued he’s much fault budging I I’m unreasonable. Mind reason wanting groomsmen “that’s dumb let bridesmaid.” AITA budging basically keeping wedding party according fiancé?So I'm product affair. My dad's wife forgave getting mom pregnant condition kids never see hear me, see mom. Even so, dad involved life right died, close. After died I contacted family members (not wife kids, I upset them) ask ok go funeral, I replies. I ended deciding since I've never met wife kids family even recognize I quietly back bother anyone. Turns wife recognize (I how) interrupted service drag building yell there, I tried leave followed mom's car yell her. Now I'm embarrassed guilty I upset caused drama funeral dragged mom it. My mom says I anything wrong cos I known dad's wife I look like, I'm sure trying make feel better. I wanted say bye dad, I trying cause trouble. AITA?My daughter (26f) I haven’t spoken years. When 15 found wasn’t biological daughter wife cheated years ago friend. As turns called “friend” suddenly interested playing dad. My wife I divorced, daughter learned truth I I still loved matter what. Of course interested now getting biological father hurt I tried accept that. She started pulling away that. Even trying still things together family longer interested. The last straw 20 living house. We arguing she’d dropped college courses, done anything 3 months mad I either needed go school work wants stay free. She I’m real dad stop pretending I she’ll go stay real father. That broke honestly. But I that’s really feels there’s really nothing left say us. And move go live him. I depressed long time, drank much. My son (24m) reason keep moving forward. For first couple years I reached daughter. She wanted contact, I learned accept move on. It helped find peace life. My son stopped talking angry her. They still chat sometimes, doesn’t bother all. Through I learned biological father died October 2019. Also she’s engaged. She reached me, first knows “we haven’t talked while” wants ask I’d willing walk isle. After pretty long message much hurt past actions, I no. She didn’t father anymore I learned longer view daughter. This turned fight us according it’s fault wanted real dad. And I agreed it’s not, fault treated ever since. In mind I hadn’t passed wouldn’t even speaking right now. It ended telling I hope enjoys wedding I part life. My son’s she’s ranting family I’m ruining day thought parents supposed love kids unconditionally. My brothers seem think now I asshole chance life again. But I interest that. Still seems everyone strong opinion I’m making difficult daughter wedding wants mean lot her. My son side comments still wearing sake sanity, I asshole?***UPDATE*** I reported first thing morning. She answered I I talk OB, couldn’t come phone right called back 20 mins later. I explained situation, thanked telling take matters seriously will looking immediately. I doubt they’ll let happens I hear anything I’ll update again. Thanks much, everyone! I (20F) recently found I’m pregnant, came surprise I’m bc. I made appointment OB that’s close high ratings confirm pregnancy, I walked I immediately concerned woman behind desk friend mom’s. They’re super close, I hadn’t seen years, they’ve known since high school I sort keep touch. I didn’t feel ready tell anyone bf obviously dr baby, I freaking little, bf assured wouldn’t able say anything mom baby without consent. When I home mom waiting already knew baby. Apparently friend texted congratulate I even make home. Everything going okay mom supportive, honestly I’m pissed lady I report OB. My family supportive baby, opened big mouth someone different kind family, outcome really bad. My bf agrees thinks it’s kinda Karen-ish, hand mom thinks friend crossed lines, report potentially put employment risk petty asshole move. I think mom’s friend asshole, potentially dangerous that. WIBTA reporting big mouth employer? Tl;dr: receptionist/office manager OB office, family friend, mom pregnancy, now I WIBTA reporting employers. ETA: it’s asked times, adding I’m US. Edit 2: I wrote comment I’ll add too, I’m going report tomorrow morning office open, since right now it’s hours answering service. I’m going make sure nothing bad happened situation, I’m reporting concern past future patients. Also goal isn’t fired, make sure situation can handle however see fit.We hosted Thanksgiving place. My brother, wife, almost four old son among guests. As people leaving, brother asked nephew take home 2 old son’s toy trucks. My nephew playing nonstop since arrived wanted keep it. My brother he’d replace toy I I it. I brother I’d happy give link store I bought it, I give toy there. I refused two reasons: firstly, brother/sister-in-law terrible habit giving nephew everything asks for. He way old that. Secondly, I don’t reinforce nephew it’s OK take things wants. My brother nephew throw tantrum didn’t toy there, everything easier I let take toy sent replacement mail. I brother I enabler nephew’s bad behavior, it’s brother/SIL’s problem throws tantrum.

AITA?Hello! [OG POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rodjrq/aita_for_standing_firm_on_my_lack_of_hygiene_and/) First, I thank everyone took respond, upvote, award, & dm me. I inundated responses really great feedback spectrum. It decided I TA, tons N A H. I took every comment heart. Even ToothbrushGate! Convo Kyle: I wanted talk bc I wanted hear reasoning/give clean break. Honestly, relatively normal, boring conversation... first. He apologized giving ultimatum/said frustrated & never hurt Crumb. I apologized laughing & making feel though feelings valid. He "pet thing" new & wants work bonding. I asked meant punish/crate. He punish meant spray water & realize cats crate animals. He tried compromise & say kissing cat's head gross, I brushed teeth/washed face after, kiss me. The comment I received Kyle & I compatible. So I that: although I appreciate apology & trying compromise, I think future work. Kyle tried backpedal bit & say can learn flexible, I kinda weird feeling. I fair either us compromise comfort. I restated Crumb non-negotiable. He rolled eyes & asked I choosing Crumb him. He asked I "seriously breaking 'stupid animal.'" This shocked bc 180 previous 15 mins. He felt rejected Crumb felt rejected first, make even? I concerning bc Crumb cat. He asked I feel kept kissing animals me. I I care bc animals/not threat. He I dense & I clearly care boundary kissing animals, say I kiss everyone. This especially hurt bc I previously stigma queer (bisexual) woman everyone assumes cheat/are promiscuous. I asked jealous Crumb. He scoffed, "you're right, never work bc will crazy cat lady boundaries/hygiene." He "enjoy alone forever" & hung up.

We've always platonic, completely honest I'm type guy go it. Yesterday, Jess supposed move. I going drive truck place, help load stuff, apartment. Her situation roommates become highly unstable due irreconcilable differences rush leave. The day yesterday, way thanking advance, Jess ordered pizza two us. We sitting watching movie couch, platonic friends usual, suddenly inched closer me. I figured nothing minute later little closer. Then little closer I think finally happening. She squeezed really close next looked face. I'm confident guy I say "hi," responded "hi." Then asked I wanted "something." I asked "something" was. And "oh y'know ... something." Still trying keep room plausible deniability, again, I laughed I "something" was. She kept staring nodding, I thought I'd take chances. I asked I kiss her. She immediately stood up, walked end room, sat armchair. Then took phone. I immediately apologized her, I forget it. A minutes incredibly awkward silence passed, "I guess Kim (her best friend) right." I asked Kim right about, explained several years, Kim repeated I trying pants. Apparently, Kim put "testing" me.

I feel kind bad, bad. Was I wrong?Hello reddit. I don’t anyone I can share thoughts person, I’m hoping guys can help resolve this. I (20m) single child... least I thought I was. Just ago, I discovered I sister, Lucy. The story goes mother child first boyfriend college, couldn’t support opted adoption birth. My father aware this, I never told. Anyways, ago made contact my/our mother. They’ve gotten pretty well, keep touch go odd lunch. Lucy’s also attended couple family events past year. Her I long fine well. We’re different people friends, I sort see acquaintance/friend family I guess. It’s little odd I we’re closely related, doesn’t feel “family” makes sense. Okay there’s back story, now dilemma. My grandparents mothers side passed years ago. My mother child, I “only” grandchild, left entire estate me. This known parents passed, expressed made will. My parents well financially (moms nurse dads doctor), fine arrangement. I given access money 20th birthday, sum money much larger I expected; totalling around 6 million. This I can’t really talk anyone impartial, I don’t really friends etc know. Anyway, weeks ago mother sat down, asked share money Lucy. Now, here’s thing; I said, Lucy essentially acquaintance. I we’re related blood, I don’t exactly feel type connection merit giving large sum money, money matter. So I explained mother, wasn’t exactly happy answer. She believes I’m extremely selfish, Lucy much benefit money well since she’s still college student debt. Here’s I think I might asshole; I don’t really see problem. I believe family feels family, shares DNA. Secondly, grandparents aware Lucys existence (even though never met her) chose leave everything same. Also, though Lucy grew poor foster system anything, adopted birth seems two great people. Her adoptive parents accountant teacher. P.S. I plan horde money. I starting law school year, plan use start firm I’m finished. So, go forth judge please. Am I selfish asshole here, I justified thinking simply related blood doesn’t merit claim here?I (33M) future parent two twin boys. Me wife recently deciding names twins wife wants matching.

For background, husband's parents strict food growing up. They restricted eat shamed eating anything deemed 'bad'. They teach good relationship food, subsequently led sneaking junk food teenager going crazy moved home. He gained lot weight eating things eat kid sense self regulation. On hand, parents forbid diet talk house categorise foods good bad, result I great relationship food. There also zero talk weight household something I carry now I raise child. My husband I 11 old daughter together far things going really well. She's never skinny kid, perfectly healthy weight age height. Lately hit growth spurt I swear grew 3 inches taller 3 months. She's bigger appetite going seconds dinner slightly bigger portions meals. She's good eater eat veggies. It's pulling teeth eat spinach anything. With growth, obviously gained little weight taller/eat more/get pre-teenage hormones working. She's still healthy. She's still playing basketball swimming everything loves. But despite this, husband really wants begin monitoring portion sizes letting go seconds, letting eat chips lollies all. I put foot absolutely not, quick way fast track ED age. He fat him. I reason weight due parents' attitude towards food, fat daughter terrifying encouraging healthy outlook kinds foods restricting. I also scared daughter eating disorder fat daughter. He called parents, never anything nice say daughter's weight. His mum typical "always diet mum" really messed sister. This last thing I daughter I feel I'm attacked them. Don't title makes sense something context... I (f33) fiance (m31) 3 years. This first official holiday (Christmas) laws since refused include previous holidays I "the girlfriend" "official".

He gave think I'm change mind insane expect me, mother chronically ill child blow kind money holiday trip. My inlaws disappointed pressuring make right decision instead dying money hill. ETA: I read comment really good question - The question wether inlaws will willing help future case I needed money emergency answer way talk money whenever I'm present I gold digger going money...It's unacceptable.

Last wanted move nice old folks home thats basically resort. To finance rest years sold main condo put sale. I bought fair rate time, since gone value 25% due recent housing surge. I finished renovations officially listed AirBnB side hustle. This summer I've gotten lots requests family visit I've renovated, I also I intend use income stream, family vacation home. I pushback held firm. &#x200B; Well now cousin engaged plan May 2022 wedding specific day significance them. This will end Memorial Day weekend. My cousin Jean called asked lakehouse since much land outdoor wedding Fiance met years ago (his family friends family). I I anticipate renting weekend can first dibs days needed sent link reserve it. She realized run close 6k plus deposits service fees, really 8k. She flipped saying family event family house I shouldnt charge. She wedding gift. I "Jean wedding 3 years ago set knives (which I like), really fair say I basically give $6,000". She flipped, called greedy terrible family member hung up. Since parents, aunt uncle, sister I greedy well. My brother helped renovations side 100% grandparents love see wedding sold house conditions wont pressure me. But Ive getting much flack couple people family... &#x200B; Edit: Im done responding comments now due many ive gotten answer common questions: In purchasing grandparents, I made clear longer family home I using income stream. They knew selling. Jean I close, 13 cousins side family, 7 years apart see probably 1-2 times most. Part thinking charging I dont place turn defacto "family spot". It cheap I take mortgage pay it. For people US, Memorial Day weekend probably popular weekend pool parties/lakehouse rentals etc. Its literally valuable weekend lakehouse. I I'd give first dibs opening anyone will easily rented weekend otherwise The current price people called ridiculous based surrounding places size going for. Since listing rate getting booked super fast, I've encouraged raise rate. It overpriced market all. What I charge actually less average venue charge amount guests wants. She'd saving 40% traditional venue charge. I also charge normal rate, holiday rate AirBnB I (and anyone else). So effectively 30% discount bat.[removed]Five days ago brother called let pretty bad storm coming, asked drive help patch stuff. He livestock didnt risk getting injured. My wife two sons (four six) stay home, wanting risk getting stuck storm. Three days ago called, let boys sick. I asked wanted back early - brother dealt rest own. She no, I stayed.

Am I asshole ruining brother's wedding potentially relationship? &#x200B;[removed]My (47F) daughter (13F) type 1 diabetic sometimes hypoglycemic. Due this, set 504 says can eat snack class whenever needed, along accommodations. Anyways, point teachers, apparently new teacher, denies snack hypoglycemic. She nearly passes next class in, teacher enough common sense let eat snack passing school. When me, I immediately called teacher. When called back, I lectured needed let daughter eat snack needed. She says snacks aren’t allowed class I tell due daughter’s 504 legally required give daughter exception rule, recommended give another read. Before hanging up, I tell I will contact principal let know. I recorded call husband’s phone way. A month goes thing happens again. I request meeting principal husband plays back call teacher. I tell done twice needs talk her. Turns out, actually fired ADA violations. How I know? I ran publix. She it’s fault I fired “some stupid snacks” I need stop raising entitled brat. Instead arguing back I walked away. Was I really TA? Did I actually go far? Context family dynamics: Me F26 stepbrother "Ethan" M30 met young, grew competative towards acted kind race everything. e.g. *he broke finger graduation day parents attend*. *He decided put dog birthday turned sad anniversary hated parents celebrating birthday still instead mourning dog*. *he married mom's death anniversary*. Years later seemed mature respectful see others gatherings hosted stepmom Ethan wants aunt future kid (he wife expecting) Days ago engagement dinner held prestigous restaurant cost & fiancè "Morgan" money. Ethan SIL showed unexpectedly congratulated us Ethan finished drink later announced gender baby wife expecting proudly saying "we found boy everyone!". It completely blue. The family excited ordered another round drinks started playing guess name chose game chimming suggestions. ME, Morgan MIL sitting watching dinner turned GR party. We ignoooored til end event. Morgan livid saying Ethan acting high school attention seeking biiish ruined night stealing spotlight redirecting & family. I something least damage control spending money hijacked event. He looked asked "what mind?" I immediately sent Ethan bill half everything Morgan I paid brief explanation expected pay. He called yesterday going hysteric saying I make pay jack shit I invited him. But I invite wife. He argued came party stepmom invited "intent" hijacking anything, someone asked question baby answered. repeating "it happened" fault people interested. I still pay talked *even* wife I claim milicious stopped asked "are you...are jealous baby presumingly stealing "night"?, nephew!!!". I called crazy jumping conclusion response owed nothing I stop making unreasonable, entitled demands. I fight called stepmom. She knock matter since fiance "well off" can always 2nd engagement dinner deal. I refused demanded pay. He wife explained I focusing aunt rather punishing that. Yes I say pay rhe wedding.Apologies, I seem remember similar post life can’t find it. Don’t mean redundant! My husband I couple 40s, we’ve married 10 years now. We 17 old children, son ex wife daughter husband passed. When married, chose keep portion finances separate due children already, previous real estate investments, expenses alimony child support payments. We combine incomes mortgage household expenses, retirement, major purchases etc. The college funds set children always part separate finances, result neither us terribly in-depth discussions regarding amount put child’s fund (we discuss goes regarding tax returns, gifts relatives, etc.). I never expected children’s funds penny penny equal, I expect closer I recently discovered. Both children now applied accepted university it’s Senior year. Now majority scholarships in, tuition housing etc. concrete school options, we’ve started specifics budget conversations. My daughter’s college/graduation fund worth roughly 150k stepson approximately 15k dollar amount. Here’s argument happened… With scholarships, daughter will enough undergraduate school likely graduate work well (assuming maintains traditionally good grades). In fact she’ll likely good bit leftover. Fine, I say, can use payment home, whatever. After scholarships 15k dad, stepson will still owe undergrad. My husband feels combine funds. When married, specifically kept certain things separate them, I can’t help feel unwilling scrap mix things together now. It doesn’t feel fair right, husband thinks it’s asshole move give kids thing. It’s never problem stepson extras due another parent household also contributing clothing, car, spending money etc., now suddenly even. And clear, “even” actually means giving stepson even money due fact daughter’s scholarships comprehensive. The kids close I’m sure stepson will realize there’s difference university money, husband wanted change things I feel brought sooner this. AITA? ETA since it’s asked: late husband quite young passed, nothing much speak way inheritance life insurance. And yes, reiterate, husband I discuss prior marriage agreed keep children’s expenses part separate accounts/finances.My boyfriend turned 30 wednesday big party celebrate it. I hadn’t feeling well last couple weeks leading I determined make birthday great one.

She lessons 3 years ago, hates driving refuses drive. She never took test driver's license. During covid decided stop working I mentioned good use practice driving test since live ton public transport, asked let wanted practice driving. After 6 months never asked practice I started pushing driving started going.

She uses zillion utensils even make coffee(don't ask how, unsolved mystery). Today, learnt new recipe mum went kitchen prepare it. When She done turned vodka pasta. It tasted horrible added entire bottle vodka. She also put much salt ended tasting salt pasta side rather pasta seasoned salt. So I make whatever wants never also clean kitchen done cooking.

So much work me. She refuses go cooking class too. I teach her. Edit 2: She boiled pasta vodka water. Then made sauce vodka. Her logic since vodka important ingredients, adding make taste better given recipe. She realize vodka makes food bitter added large quantities.[removed][removed]I (m32) two older brothers (m38 m40) sister (f34). Note age differences.

I corrected her, I fact ordered 5 star. When came back dish I tasted it, spicy *at all.* It even 3 star. I sent dish back, came back moments later appeared red chile flakes sprinkled top. I asked it, sarcastically I ordered spicy. I makes sense sprinkle red chile flakes *green curry* supposed made *green chiles.* It honestly looked hideous, I tried anyway. It *still* spicy, I sent back. When I dish third time, exactly first I got. So I sent back again, red chile flakes sprinkled top again. It was, time, spicy—so I sent back fourth time. When I dish fifth time, I happy see red chili flakes sprinkled top. The waitress, sarcastic tone, made *extra spicy* me, going stand watch eat it, took away water glass.

However lots people put ‘meat’ ‘meat eater’ space. talking relatives last week family together (all vaccinated allowed country) confirmed weren’t serving animal products started giving us grief ‘forcing’ vegan assholes accommodating diets. It’s 2 meals lives, aren’t forcing anyone change diet neither fiancé food wedding don’t eat, don’t think checking ingredients list, enjoy ourselves. We also paying everything ourselves.

We’ve together long always worked different cities made sense keep separate places, now job city buying place together. His flat sold quickly, I’m still process selling mine. So I put flat market luckily it’s fair amount interest. Pretty early investor buyer, someone already owns multiple properties intended buy flat rent profit, submitted offer 10k less it’s worth, probably hoping capitalise someone desperate move they’d sell cheap. Obviously I rejected offer, couple weeks later lovely father disabled son looking accessable ground floor flat mine move help son gain independence, viewed property multiple times put offer exactly I wanted it. I met briefly seemed nice people. As I don’t agree landlords principle, I thrilled able sell flat I loved much people deserved it. They made offer Friday I waiting Monday formally accept it, weekend investor buyer low balled previously, came woodwork offered 2 1/2 grand man son. So here’s fiancé I disagree. He thinks I take highest offer, I don’t owe anything father son, I turn money? He also believes we’re going buying property together, say much money I end put towards it. Thing is, never intending use money made selling flats next property anyway, always going go back savings, I I happy take loss savings rather his.

So reddit, AITA?I worked current job almost 3 years. It's smaller company less 100 employees scattered across handful regional offices. Because I work people different offices quite bit, lot communication via email. There person particular I work habit signing emails "God Bless You." He will also find ways put bible quotes scripture emails I find rather inappropriate work.

After 6-months job, I brought boss coworkers email habit. He aware agree either, different office manager office thinks ok I try ignore it. So, I did. I bit tongue tried ignore it. For almost 2 years I ignored it. Until day particular coworker added scripture email sent I I rough day. I understand trying helpful way, rubbed wrong way I patience anymore.

It professional email, succinct point, also clear I trying communicate. I signed email "As-Salaam-Alaikum." Not even 10-minutes later I called boss's office. He asked hell I mocking someone else's religion that. I I mocking anything, I simply conveying coworker, writing, I prefer keep religion future correspondence. He sure hell seemed I mocking coworker's Christianity using Muslim saying email. I asked even knew phrase meant didn't. So I means, "Peace unto you." I thinks ok someone say God Bless You every email, ok say As-Salaam-Alaikum well. He leave office back work. A couple days later company-wide email put CEO outlining new email policies regarding religion, politics, personal views. It clearly laid none kind personal viewpoints included company email, exceptions. Shortly email sent out, Christian coworker sent text personal phone simply "I hope happy, asshole."[removed][removed]My parents (16M) kinda young last decided another baby.

His mom overbearing since day one, example first I met asked I “pleasing son enough sexually” wanted many times/week I making finish. She also always calls sexy asks touch arms abs (which doesn’t think weird) that’s story different day. readers understand kinds things says loud. She lately (the past two months) hostile toward whenever around saying I “getting way relationship son” I need “let alone more.” My fiance tells wants spend he’s working can either see us neither us. This last saw her, eating dinner house new husband fiances brothers nowhere “I hope children look dad.” This nowhere that’s always is.

I doesn’t really matter right now I will budge comes.[removed]I (42M) wife (38F) daughter (14) friends son (13) acquaintance mine. Because daughter friend different genders, wife insists always supervising playdates. Our daughter go house; come here. She always watches kids together let daughter close door room. TBH, I always thought wife fairly reasonable incident. Kids kids, nearing complicated age. So I always backed wife up, even daughter begged allowed friend's house. Recently, wife watching kids I work realized needed things store. She made children go alone. Apparently (I'm obviously getting info second hand) kids wondered shopping. While alone, employee approached daughter's friend accused stealing something. My daughter's friend turned jacket pockets, nothing phone keys. The employee demanded daughter's friend remove jacket, thought something hidden jacket. My daughter's friend refused steal anything. My daughter called wife, showed pretty quickly. My wife sided employee asked daughter's friend remove jacket. When did, employee saw necklace wearing demanded take inspect see merchandise store. I've seen wearing necklace before, record. At point, ran store cold, wearing jacket, called grandfather come pick up. I work acquaintance called me, furious. He son half frozen dad (which I believe, cold right now) wife profiled son. He son going house ever again. Edit: My daughter wants add this. She, unlike me, use reddit properly edit posts. Her friend mixed race. His father Indian (like India, Native American). A lot people asked I know, hopefully see this. Edit 2: My wife texted emergency I needed call her, I stepped theater so. Guess what. No emergency. (No surprise either.) She I right separate daughter Christmas. I choice confronted daughter breakfast, especially food thing. She started crying I idea "that boy" put through. I hung up. Fuck this. It's Christmas. I'm watching Home Alone daughter. Edit 3: My daughter comment needs post itself. (Yeah, paying attention movie last. She's become really intrigued comments phone last 20 minutes.) I'm pasting in. She showed how. So daughter I movies right now. After breakfast go home, going go Christmas movie marathon local theater. She went snacks (I $30, come back small tub popcorn, damn concession prices), I'm going tell guys happened breakfast. It lot, apologies stuff seems rushed over. Ask clarification like. My wife blowing phone right now, I talk her. This first something happened, first happened public. Here's things daughter wife kept quiet fear allowed hang anymore (I know. I'm POS. I understand now. I hate myself.) My wife screamed kid giving daughter gymnastics lesson. (He's gymnastics team. They anything dangerous.) She made stop called pervert. (I know. I know.) She screamed playing makeup. (It belonged daughter gift sister. I think expensive stuff. Even though, cares?) She made wash face go home. (He grandfather stomach ache day apparently.) She eats much food house. (This worst me. I mad MAD that.) So... Yeah. Learned stuff wife. It's clear now I active member marriage long time. This hard learn. The hardest part knowing daughter trust assumed I side mom. I let daughter read thread. She wanted made change perspective, I her. She wanted read comments people made. I hesitant foul language, but... She's fourteen. She's baby, I hears bad school. We talking lesbian comments. She asked I think that. I I care. (I really wouldn't.) She might bi sure. I cried little bit, I made feel tell that, honestly? I'm even ashamed stuff wife, twisted is. My wife daughter getting along while. A lot centers around friend, it. My wife daughter view world fundamentally different ways. Edit 4: I asked daughter stop reading stuff post. Obviously now seen can go Reddit phone find again, trust start somewhere, right? We gave Christmas marathon. We're upset sit still watch movie. I took sister's went home talk wife. I needed things straightened I took daughter home. It go well. My wife apologized I home. She crying. She holidays stressful bit breakdown. She begged go daughter bring home. I I talked. She kept sobbing, I went water. I talk I leave, I going daughter talked. Eventually stopped crying talked me. She fessed gymnastics incident daughter's friend touched inner thigh. My daughter never mentioned part. I asked wife never this, give straight answer. The makeup incident wanted daughter wear makeup certain event mad wasted it. Also sharing makeup sharing soap unsanitary. I this. Again, I feel justifies reaction. Also, wife buy makeup, I think right mad "waste." The food thing misconstrued. She took larger necessary portion eat it. She take smaller initial portion next time. We problem son teenager, I believe glad trying keep poor kid eating. I I go family therapy agreed. I'm sitting living room now calming I go back sister's daughter. That extremely emotionally draining. What way spend Christmas morning Edit 5: My daughter refused go home. I felt forcing destroy relationship good, kind hanging sister's. My sister left ready holiday plans, talking. The reason I'm updating freaked out, I need advice I say wrong thing alienate good. Because uncharted me. My wife calling constantly, I've ignoring her. I wrong, react even worse me, I talk right now. I asked daughter feelings friend. She know. She friendship "more important that." I legitimately understand means, I nodded. She "only understands" her. She also loves learning gymnastics him, makes feel good, body something beautiful instead burden. I idea interpret that. She also that, addition makeup, sometimes (I managed without wife noticing, lost it) wear other's clothes. She likes wearing boy clothes likes seeing dresses skirts. Again, I nodded thanked telling me. I say!! Help!!!I (f36) lost 3 old son chronic condition born with. I struggled lot illness receieved lot support family ex husband busy work care son.

I explained thats whats fun always order la carte menu bbq. But "just make us" insisted calling waitress asking put meat grill demanded served ready . This elderly Korean lady shuffle busy tables come flip meat serve plates. But wait. It gets worse. So point I'm super embarrassed seeing red flags crazy (Im indian I'm kinda used whole servant master attitude thing cause big india, I'm fan it, I thought super weird states) But I wanted see date end ( yes shamelessly enough I hoping 'adult' time.) At end meal, asks dessert. I agree ask see menu. The waitress comes gives menu hands her. She waits leave says "My god place nightmare, useless immigrants (shes white) come country even work eat tax dollars. Are even legal?" And loudly enough nearby table brown people 20s started giving dirty looks whispering other. She notices goes "same goes *insert racist word people pakistan*" . At point jaw dropped.

She started crying, called bitch I deserve mother wished children born mother me. I hung that. Since mother paternal aunts also suffer fertility issues texting messaging me, calling inconsiderate selfish. Kyle, dad maternal family this. My mother says since plan baby hurt give away twins especially still family.

I grew small, rural town kind way everyone lived. It I moved away college I really exposed different viewpoints, people, lifestyles. My fiance (24F) complete opposite. She's always city girl grew environment diversity differences commonplace celebrated. We engaged 6-months ago planning wedding next spring. We've spent plenty around other's families parents. My fiance sibling trans gay. When I met them, first people I met lived way took lot learning, questions, awkward conversations part pre-conceived notions head. My parents type people pray every meal, go church every Sunday, dad hunts, mom cooks, animal mounts walls. Very traditional say old-fashioned. But generous loving taught work ethic independence young age. Our families interacted before, place Thanksgiving year. It awkward first, given different are, harsh words spoken everyone left encounter nothing good things say other. Last weekend went visit parents weekend. We happened visit bow-hunting season deer dad went early every morning. He came home nice buck day hanging shed. He excited came home come see fiance came with. She grossed asked dad kill animal that. He explained uses meat feed family, including sausage breakfast previous day. She upset can never understand "people you" can kill animals that. I see dad bristle "people you" comment I quickly took fiance inside. I private talk needs tolerant family's lifestyle, tolerant family. She different family change sexualities gender family easily change. I tolerance goes ways might agree it, mean gets chastise family it. She feel comfortable around type lifestyle I upset. I family I nothing accepting family, despite unfamiliarity I expect tolerant accepting mine too. She called asshole taking side rest stay really awkward really quiet distant ever since.(i never used platform sorry I anything wrong, also English pretty good, first language) (edit - I informed word I mean condescendingly, descendingly, thank you) So basically son professional aerial performer currently performing large popular horror themed circus live. I I may biased opinion, really good amazing watch perform, maybe little scary sometimes I sometimes worry tricks acts does. My wife however will tell people works circus. Never mentioning aerial performer, actually works independently basically contractor (i proper terms, best way I can describe it), works large popular circus. Just works circus. Whenever sees clown will point say “look, \[son’s name\]”. And clear looks does, assumes makes next nothing "poor". I he’s. He make crazy amount, makes enough support well. This came head friends ask son entertain kids birthday party, promising pay “generously” since “he must struggling”. My wife laughed responded “ill see free”. I butted saying “he probably able since birthday falls day \[popular circus\], works headline aerial act fully booked close New Year.” Almost everyone shocked since info new them, wife looked pissed left. She sat car texted wants leave. I stayed 20 mins answering questions showing videos. The woman asked apologised, saying given impression wife son struggling failing cheap circus performer wanted help him. When I finally left car wife yelled me, saying I made look idiot horrible mother front friends. When home stormed car locked bedroom crying loudly almost hour now I’m starting feel awful AH. I left alone, AITA?I title bit… off, let explain. Me (30 F) wife (29 F) welcomed son world ago, families accepting us wife’s family weird obsession “passing family genes”, made adopting question early on. Me wife always wanted start family things difficult wife found infertile, knew family understanding TERRIFIED pregnancy, im almost physically identical bio mom died child birth led believe wouldn’t hold pregnancy well. After months brainstorming let down, MIL suggested IVF, using eggs BIL’s sperm, let wife carry baby. I skeptical first gave plan hit marks, family genes “passed on”, My wife start family, don’t carry baby. went extensive counseling therapy make sure everyone page handle it. The procedure bit expensive wife’s grandma happily covered cost since baby first new generation family. Everything went great, wife loved pregnant (aside morning sickness) overjoyed welcome baby boy winter. The problem arose last week, preparing sons first birthday BIL made comment say planning child’s father. I shocked. I cringed wasn’t, provided sperm, looked straight eye “yeah, he’s child”. I looked wife whose mouth wide open MIL wasn’t making eye contact. Before say anything else demanded house he’d able come party apologized, angry left wife started cry. My wife always struggled self esteem infertility really took toll her, months constantly reassure amazing mother wasn’t “wrong” (she faced lot homophobia misogyny growing up) SIL called later day called bitch, I argue BIL right saying SIL kept yelling. Me wife cut contact family, it’s turned something bigger needs refuse let someone call family incomplete again. call dramatic I grew family never knowing “real family” refuse let happen son. BIL signed away rights verbally agreed multiple times he’s uncle. He’s never problem now it’s kinda blue. If starting feel connection son i’d understand calmly spoke wife instead staking claim. i’ve reached BIL times looking reason thrown insults wife i. My wife devastated loosing contact neither us forgive BIL apologizes. So… asshole? Edit: We don’t MIL stands, she’s expressed BIL line also technically father. MIL steps senses conflict, that’s wasn’t making contact. many people going MIL she’s essentially wife i’s side, it’s FIL wanted genes passed on. Edit: Also, SIL wife’s sister, BIL’s wife, BIL’s wife isn’t close contact us i’m sure even knows what’s going on.I (34F) went Stuyvesant High School NYC.

I will grant maybe little top, like, I still suffer physically mentally day. I deeply impacted forever changed, classmates. You witness something be. I actual buildings, I right saw all. But I know, maybe I consider survivor? Maybe I tone down? My husband says I'm right, I family is, uncomfortable emotional stuff I mindful posts.

ETA: answer seems common question, yes state grandparents rights apply.[removed]My (25f) sister (27f) severe mental health issues made extraordinarily difficult function. I’ve taken care since kids. Our dad stroke I 8, mom look died 11 years later. Our two brothers (40 42) much older us busy jobs girlfriends (now wives). My family even given nickname, Carer Sarah (Sarah name). I don’t particularly it, whatever. My mom now sister’s primary carer, I well I’m often called step in. The terrible thing is, I don’t really sister. I think I once, years I spent much emotional energy I’ve burnt out. To give flavour life her, called 3am night I due hugely important interview standing bridge jump off. I drove 4 hours missed interview. She seduced boyfriend 16th birthday party shouted everyone hear reason I born mom abortion went wrong. She another boyfriend I’d cheated (I hadn’t). She racked $10k debt credit card 3 days. I none fault, I feel towards apathy. It means actions longer hurt me. She can so, sweet sometimes, never lasts, I’ve learned dislike her, endure her. I’ve never, ever anyone that, whole family impression I love dearly much I’ve done years. Two years ago I met love life we’re getting married next year. The truth is, I don’t even really sister all. I can’t think single event centred hasn’t way disrupted her. I can’t invite her, instead I regular guest. This also means will easier mom keep eye her, she’s bridesmaid I I’ll end it. And I bridesmaids people I actually love, love too, will make day easier. My cousins sides sisters bridesmaids, I’m going family tradition here. My mom brothers shocked, say it’s extremely damaging sister rejected this. One brothers says I'm ableist. My mom says always thought day she’s old take care sister I’ve worked years I look full (this news me), now she’s sure. All made feel bad sister, I’m close giving in. But I do, won’t I to. So, looking honest opinions here. AITA sister bridesmaid?Back story: I'm 29M I've EMS almost 7 years, I've paramedic department year. Now onto story. This happened shifts ago. We call 0600 pediatric full arrest. When scene, heart dropped. The parents put 6mo bed last night went bed. When dad leave work, opened door see baby leaving noticed baby breathing. I stood minute thinking I going tell new parents bad news. The baby cold touch, pale, lividity set in... baby died middle night. I tried convey sympathy fault tragedies happen. The parents understandably inconsolable. The rest shift silent. When I home, I kept running conversation parents head again.I called friend asked I come talk. I went apartment talked hours it. I emotional wreck first infant death. He tried best could, fiancé came home work. She came front door instantly started complaining "worst day ever" customer gave attitude. When walked living room saw me, "I bad day I people need leave right now." When friend something terrible happened work looked "All sit around, watch TV, play Xbox. How terrible can be?" My friend I stunned. She kept going I basically 10 minutes work 24hr shifts works much harder me. I already bad place emotionally hearing say things made blood boil. I finally looked eyes, "You bad day even looks like! You mildly annoyed 5 minutes it. I look 2 new parents eyes tell baby died last night sleeping! Just THOUGHT knowing called us save baby I powerless anything kills inside, I that, matter bad I feel, feeling much much worse. Now tell me, YOU still think bad day?" And I stormed out. My friend called days later check me. I better process everything. He went say long talk fiancé happened I really messed her. She crying since I left. I feel I may AH I lashed rage I handled better. So AITA?I know, I know. He’s grown man, let explain. We 4 month child together helped beyond changing diaper maybe week. I cooking, cleaning, 99% baby care me. I’ve asked take overnight shift before, he’s snapped saying “I work I need sleep I can put food table you.” Tbh stung, I dropped that. Anyway. Weekdays works day he’s exhausted comes home, wants hang play games brothers drink beer. I tell I appreciate working I can take care son go school. I cook. I clean laundry can rest. Weekends doesn’t work, I feel can help little more. On top full-time mom, I’m also finishing final semester college. So weekends, agreed watch baby least hour I can submit assignments time, usually Sunday 11:59 kind deal. Or let take shower since child glued hip rest day. Hence 11pm curfew, I hour timed exams enough complete. He yet respect agreed upon come home can I shower schoolwork done, can spend quality husband wife since he’s busy week goes every weekend. When brothers coworkers “curfew”, I immediately labeled controlling, nagging bitch wife. It hurt. I don’t argue requests asked calm collected manner: “I exam due Sunday. Can make help I can knock out?” I guess you’re there, it’s easy assume. Despite that, won’t come home weekends 1 2 AM, ignoring text I remind timed exams homework. Then snaps I don’t let reward working week. I’m really hurt name calling. I pride laidback, flexible, understanding. AITA? Should I forget curfew? Edit: Just I’m repeating myself, English first language. I didn’t realize now word “curfew” negative meaning behind it. I didn’t mean belittle him. That’s me. Also, thanks support! I didn’t expect that. I’m definitely looking around finding good counselor us. I’ve already called insurance list names. We solid marriage baby. If can work out, I’d that. Until then, I’m looking local mom group support I finish college. Or counseling works husband steps up. Update: So many supportive I can’t thank enough it. Even though it’s strangers Reddit, means lot cheered continue education caring son. For info: husband wasn’t always this. 8 years together always helped somehow. Chores done. Encouraging change degree age 24 I miserable. Supporting best friend back stabbed me. Staying night taking 8 days work I miscarried first take care me. You guys helped realize red flags courage realize I need put foot down. Being laid back isn’t going save marriage. Last night, husband home, sat talked. Really talked. We stayed late. I need counseling I’ll leave continues. And I’m going family, 2000 miles away, there’s chance seeing either us unless flies out. By look face, I guess didn’t realize bad gotten. The thing joked coworker brothers (apparently collective 3) something said. In moment, he’d laughed off. He didn’t realize “locker room talk” affect me. He will stop never call again. This morning, I woke breakfast coffee bedside. I text asking I’d go grocery shopping watches baby gets home today I hour two house. For context, I *like* grocery shopping. I run errands Target I friend meeting can grab coffee I’m it. My shopping limited 50% coffee talking, 45% goofing aisles browsing stuff I don’t need, 5% actually getting groceries need. Next weekend made plans take us lunch walk local flower garden baby. I hope keeps getting better. We good 8 years together. If possible, I’d continue that. Thanks everyone! Bear hugz around 💛 Final update: Not sure will see last part it’s couple days now. Counseling went well. He wants routine thing. I’m still waking coffee breakfast bedside table. When comes home doesn’t go straight fridge beer anymore—he’s eagerly waiting hand baby over. I’ve able go campus library print assignments without worrying. And I came home, bathroom oven deep cleaned. The man I knew fell love slowly coming back. Obviously, things I need work too, speaking often. Well. That’s enough divulging personal life Reddit. Thanks kind words support!I (32/f) live partner (44/m) work research. My primary colleague (30/m) I worked together \~2 years major project involving significant intellectual labor contributions us both. The project expected span least another \~2 years, vital careers. Not long ago, colleague confessed is, been, infatuated love pretty much duration. It took place via long email written evening drinking. This totally unexpected - retrospect may signs, nothing easily accounted considerate personality. Shortly confession, I came husband issue. I wanted advice situation, showed drafts I'd composed organize thoughts matter - stated unequivocally I'm interested romantic relationship, hope feelings complicate work together. I surprised husband's reaction - seemed offended, think I must invited colleague's affections, I immediately quit job. As in, put notice tomorrow. I taken aback immediate reaction laugh / snort suggestion, probably mistake. That utterly disastrous career, option I'm willing consider. I'd greatly prefer entire scenario never happened, difficult lengthy project hangs balance, I real concern point colleague forcing issue letting compromise work. It seemed intoxicated "getting feelings chest". I'll need put lot thought caution I proceed work dynamic, abandoning project even table. About week passed. My husband alternating irate silent treatment, suggested several times I move house new spouse. Today I swung house lunch break found locks changed luggage patio. I blocked work number cell. Obviously possibly intend really move out, pulling (what I absolutely believe assholish) power sulk - seeing seriously taking doubts up. Maybe I ultimately uncompromising I refused even entertain quitting job sake conversation feelings, shut idea abruptly. AITA? UPDATE: Hubby called me. Long story short extremely anxious day I leave work, buckled pressure today. I'm "welcome back" home I've quit job, obviously still unacceptable. I considering taking week accrued paid leave, will hopefully result adult conversation husband (as well coming decision best handle colleague). That failing, I'm hearing word "lawyer" loud clear throughout comments! I'm grateful support perspective. UPDATE 2: I ended calling sister (38/f) - something I avoided initially I "stir pot" involving family members already disliked husband. I'm currently cousin (35/m), supportive. Our plan call locksmith tomorrow (to regain access property - husband can ruminate friends hotel present), cousin collect important things mine house, stay sister days I take hard look situation options. I'm set divorce point, I definitely need re-assert basic boundaries exploring discussion husband. Thank you, strangers Reddit, helping emerge emotional haze clarity. UPDATE: Enormous thanks private messages comments locked. I'm little overwhelmed life general right now, I replied everyone, I wanted update let known I'm safe well. My husband tried bar cousin entering family home retrieve things, escalated physical confrontation. The police arrived husband cousin made leave premises. My sister I changed locks next day secure house, I'm staying family little I plan next move (which will likelihood divorce). Thanks who've shared feedback concern.I’m 16(f), I live parents.

It’s short, TL;DR He grasped straws much happened, sorry disappoint. I (38F) three kids, 13F, two 16 olds male female twins. All three kids friend groups dating, 16s dating people friends generally group since middle late school, 13 recently girlfriend friend moment. Me husband(42) always fine partners friends coming long shoot us text first, rule bringing new person every single day, staying past 1AM max. Recently, husband trying change family dynamic lot, family breakfast dinner instead usual grab go room, constant outings game nights, etc. We family often, extent (4-5 times week now) Last week, proposed idea family meeting me. We never these, never needed to, something needs change talk whenever we’re free. He discussed private, I I hated idea. The meeting apparently supposed longer wanted children company doesn’t outside kids house. All children sweet friends, even offer wash dishes dinner kind sweet. None loud, messy, bad influences, etc. Maybe swears inappropriate talk, I chalk teenagers. He asked keep secret, mandatory, he’d tell kids night before. I pissed I also forced family meeting refused even budge mandatory I ended chatting friend phone. Turns 13 listening in, I since asked. My 16s joined in, talked together agreed weird unwanted change, kids asked talk thought unfair sudden couldn’t friends unstated reason. I husband full story I also everyone thought unnecessary meeting mandatory, should’ve us upfront issue friends, etc. Husband blew meeting incredibly important (still refused say was) coming whether liked matter what. The meeting two days, I don’t fully blow husband since apparently important, since refuses tell us actual issue is. I take kids house appointed meeting unless actually tells issue children’s company is. I see true point guests respectful haven’t made trouble. (Edit; We going old man’s meeting now, blows face kids upset him, I won’t punish disagreeing, even straight telling he’s wrong.)My ex, Cara , sweet, amazing daughter, Layla. I've Layla's life since 5 (now 14). We've always gotten along super well, ridiculously close. Layla never met biological father, considers father, calls dad. I consider daughter. My ex I planned children together. Though least 30 financially stable. Despite waiting protection false positive 2 years ago, started trying yet. About month Cara realised children. We tried work out, I wanted children, Cara didn't. Despite trying figure marriage counselling, broke four months ago. However, major issue, Layla. I legally mother's ex-boyfriend. My lawyer I rights see Layla Cara disapproves. And Cara took separation hard. She feels I'm choosing blood Layla (not all) let see her. I've missed much, seeing Layla killing me. But giving going back bad idea, according therapist anyway. This context actual event. Last month Layla showed work upset, even skipped school see me. She hoping I'd come see felt betrayed hadn't. I took back school talked. She felt abandoned, dad (me) didnt love her. I ended telling truth. That I love anything, always daughter even I see her. Where I may crossed line explaining I legally see anymore without Cara's ok. And Cara changes mind, I'll happily involved life. She seemed happier I dropped off, end well. A week later Cara called furious. Apparently Layla trying convince let see her, even take back (I ask to, NOT say I wanted Cara back). Since I talked apparently refused listen mother extremely rude cruel. Layla basically acting Cara lets see her. Cara wants talk end it. As I her, I'm happy tell Layla stop good, I'm going tell I see her. My parents think I'm unnecessarily cruel Layla. They say I'm unfair involving matters Cara, now I listen Cara end things. My friends basically understand I'm acting way, I given Layla 'false hope'. I honestly think I abandoned hated her. I love anything. Clearly gone well I hate idea lying Layla I feel. Because I her. But maybe cruel selfish everyone saying. AITA Edit: messages I've seen since waking up, I think I explain relationship clear enough. We never married marriage. It regret retrospect, we, especially Cara, really believe idea marriage. Our break difficult. Neither us really wanted break up, even though understood compatible anymore. It come following ending it, Cara coming. I NOT blame break Cara. We Layla specific issue (children), knows I ended it. She also aware mutual problem, I never acted Cara's fault together, visiting. Also, I'd happy contribute Layla financially well physically/emotionally. I time. Cara letting me. Edit again: Adoption never came honestly. I've dad, everyone knows it. We never thought making legal honestly. Dumb, I now, I never thought since relationship real me. Our counselling discuss Layla, Cara upset, originally thought relatively split, I see day 2 week. I obviously 50/50, ok that. Then split actually occured really hard Cara apparently decided different. Also, I say already blood. I literally big family multiple children. Not blood biological. I'd happy adopted, Cara wants children whatsoever.For might confused; my(35f) husband (46M) believes 18, son(M14) conceal room care. This things straining relationship lately, I think teen freedom, maybe completely sight, door least, husband keeps insisting almost freedom all.

He declined, complained much easier grandfather's time, "homemaker" anything "her duties". I exploded. We biggest screaming match lives, calling breadwinner household, repeatedly hiding behind claim "goes out" work (as opposed working home, means I'm housewife uh?). I steamrolled claims pointing I earn much money him, I work longer hours still chores. I quit job dedicate chores, since enamored simpler times homemakers breadwinners - even became unemployed, financial situation change. He acted appalled. Monday, I gave list chores do, 2-3 hours chores daily. He constantly complains, I reply "Quit job." I spent years ALL chores top job, whines prospect half. Tuesday night, refused chores I force him. I shouted submission, telling I spent entire common life picking ball keeps dropping, choice work unskilled job pocket change preclude helping *me, breadwinner*, keep household shape. Yesterday, I locked PS5 safe changed combination. This nature - I usually polite soft spoken, I feel asshole see looking sad puppy whining tired. But I just... snapped.

There number security company can call disturbances 10pm, I frequent caller number I refuse tolerate loud music screaming I'm trying relax sleep. Now thing calling security company: send security guard stop disturbance, people causing disturbance charged time. Recently, debate sparked community Facebook group another student made post picture bill received disturbance call (they billed roughly 170$). The post read something "please remember live student area go talk people causing disturbance call security, probably funds spare disturbance call, will keep ask". I mentioned perhaps loud party 10 pm pay price, responsibility middle night ask keep even making noise first place. I immediately called asshole shows consideration people's situations. So, AITA calling security student parties, even though I charged disturbance? Note: I live US. Even though students tend live tight budget, automatically dirt poor debt ears. ETA: I tried talking people partying twice I first moved in, literally nothing happened, I gave started calling security instead. ETA: It's people partying every time, can people building surrounding buildings. I live area 2000 student rooms apartments plenty people wanting party. Depending parties can happen often twice week.

Loves dogs, baby sisters well rounded. He *doesn't like* school gonna go beyond something committed to. Mr. G asked really acceptable lifestyle I outright sons home life good matters well decides school. In teacherlike way I'm failing Alex type mentality gonna ruin future. Of course Alex's mom informed agrees Alex full I need prioritize school life else I'm failing him. Am I though? INFO: Alex ADHD (he's medicated) , friends many school (they share classes). His GPA 2.8-2.9 He, gets MOSTLY Bs , worst Cs. He's loser dropout, shows up, work, homework. He office hours extra credit (the reason teacher believes applying himself). He's flunking, average.

A lot people critical family kicked unlikely parent this. Obviously I great child eyes general final straw speak. Also desi parents different level parents... washing fathers feet, speaking unless spoken to, allowed talk opposite sex viewing head house almost God figure, bit different. Desi parents also incredibly strict, room needs clean strict, clean entire house, wash cars, wash iron everyone's clothes getting beaten broom. For people talking house prices, yeah Sydney wack, House prices jump around bit course, generally speaking live house harbour cheap. Our former PM lived $70m $90,? House Point piper.So I'm 24 old moved parents place couple years back. My parents terrible people cruel brother growing up. I've much enjoyed space life I've truly felt safe. My twin brother (Zack ) move also pretty miserable living parents. About 8 months ago asked GF (Kat) stay while, started school couple years financially place can afford place. Knowing shitty parents are, much good guy gal Zack Kat really much decision. I chip can long I'm paying food anything chill being. Things fine Zack Kat nothing respectful place. The place smaller side Zack usually school work Kat works good amount time, I'm usually super bothered it. Their plan love Zack graduates will probably 2023 rate going. So I'd likely living another half two years. Now wasnt much issue really anywhere go I totally wanting move back parents. The thing tho week back revealed pregnant. While I think awesome, excited them, severely throws wrench living arrangement. I really deal baby living us extended future. I'm someone sensitive noises suffers insomnia. So crying baby literally make life hell Earth. When I asked planning going keep Kat believe abortion feel make good parents ( definitely would, great people) . I oh well congrats then! We ended conversation night. The next day I asked plans housing near future sleeping condition I'd feel baby/toddler house. They theyd stay really anywhere else go. I happening reasons stated earlier. They upset accused "forcing abort baby" TLDR: AITA allowing brother GF continue living baby?Hi, I 23f dating 33m. I’m feeling super conflicted right now boyfriend shared story experience working paramedic. Basically, preface funny extremely messed story. He twisted sense humor partner work does, too… I felt far. On story: arrived scene 25 old dead girl drowned part job pronounce people dead obtain death. His partner unzipped mesh bag body in, partner “turn over. I wanna see ass. Did see way back arched laying flat?” My boyfriend proceeded flip see ass (she wasn’t naked, wearing bikini), flip back put back bag. The police officers scene looked disgust. My boyfriend expected laugh, I think far, violative, frankly little gross. He says it’s serious regrets sharing me. AITA?I (20f) playing Dungeons & Dragons years now online group. We went hiatus I really missed playing I started looking another group. My coworker (22m) heard invited join game started. It irl I really wanted try I hear much better irl online I enthusiastically yes. Well I showed play vibes immediately off. I girl table, definitely youngest (everyone else 22-26). They questioned character choice, saying group really needed healer I already chosen different skillset. For anyone familiar D&D fantasy tropes general, single girl ALWAYS healer/mother figure I wanted avoid costs. After debate, coworker shut let play character I wanted. I walked right then, I stuck around play two sessions. They. Were. Hell. Every choice I made character ignored questioned, players’ characters flirted harassed character every interaction. They barely let anything game fought character able date mine. In middle second session, asked character’s bra size was. I stood “nope. Not going take anymore. You guys fun” walked out. Ever since they’ve blowing phone saying I ruined game, I shouldn’t walked that. I’ve blocked messages started getting insulting. However, coworker hasn’t really talked since I feel I tried resolve issue different way since I never group I uncomfortable character romance. AITA situation? EDIT: holy crap everyone, I didn’t think post much attention! I can’t reply all, thank everyone left supportive comment! It means lot actually messed I wasn’t overreacting. Also I’m sorry anyone who’s similar experience, it’s shitty feeling. I think I’m going put search group hold now, I’m definitely going give up!

She tells really cut hair short, hair nice (her words, I really care) "waste" cut it. She remembers I'm going sister's Maid Honor couple months, I'll graduation spring, I'll regret short hair photos. Honestly I pretty offended that. As grown woman whether I regret hairstyle line none business, long cut well. She shortest go long bob, I I leaving, I want. She tried pay "cancelation fee", now going lose 2 hours booked, I paid. I problem, I left anyways. On way out, I welcome back. I relayed story friends today, response mixed.

This pretty easy understand.** I went bachelorette party Atlantic City. After 4-hour drive, bride (we’ll call Melissa) bothered seat give hug introduce girls. No made effort dinner. When bill came, girls we’d split evenly, unfair I drink alcohol ordered multiple drinks. There 11 girls I didn’t didn’t split bill, I ended pay $65 $13 meal. Then went nightclub. When around 2 AM, ears ringing much, I sleep night. Despite sleeping, I early Saturday, going escape room noon. I made entire house breakfast girls eat quickly make time. But overslept missed it. Then brunch, ride nightmare. I mention I appointed designated driver. Half girls took Uber since car seats 5 people, half went me, including Melissa. It storming AC streets flooded; I’m talking water thighs. I think old car make it. The girls see kind car I drive decided "complain" can’t file taxes jointly husbands combined income $400K, I chauffeured them. Not splitting bill unfair I don’t drink, since I driving everyone around, I paying gas parking fees. They insisted splitting brunch bill too, I pay $45 $15 lunch. After rain stopped, went boardwalk scavenger hunt. Melissa chose teams even put team! I'm MOH yet spend extra "best friend". Then girls wanted drinks boardwalk, I excluded conversation. I quirky girl amongst sorority-types. We scheduled booze cruise arrival 5:30 PM, started nearing 5, I going, girls wanted finish drinks SCRAMBLE there. Again, half girls took Uber half went me, find car. Melissa started flipping missing cruise, girls took Uber ditched parking garage. At point, I broke started sobbing. I drove back Airbnb ($450/person) packed stuff. I left around 9 PM drove night. No texted see I made home. Melissa talked since - I guess mad leaving. AITA leaving? Did I overreact? **TL;DR I left bachelorette party appointed designated driver, forced pay people’s drinks, ditched parking garage. AITA walking out?** **ADDITIONAL DETAILS:** \- The bride asked specifically plan bridal shower, NOT bachelorette party. She another bridesmaid plan bachelorette party, though bride bridesmaid dropped ball it. \- The bride sent itinerary events advance. She outlined when. So times I seemed neurotic schedule, I wanted bride able everything list. \- I feel girls malicious toward all. They already knew content talking amongst themselves. I feel left out, I think targeted specifically all. One-on-one, however brief interactions were, girls nice me. \- The responsibility I ahead (like 4 days party) bride asked charge games, specifically ice breaker games. There even allotted slot schedule games, never around playing them. When I gave suggestions games (ahead time), "overdone" "was hoping something unique". I appreciate response her. \- Not bride ask drive flood brunch, run couple errands brunch. Again, streets absolutely flooded, tell I nervous driving (I much), take feelings consideration forced drive. \- I made bride aware ahead financial situation. She knew I hurting money I recently spend $12,000 home repairs series bad luck (replacing water heater, broken AC, damage chimney, etc.). She care. \- I flat girls car I take zero responsibility remembering car parked I bad sense direction. The girls fine remember I parked help find car later. Obviously remember car parked. **- ONE GIRL stay behind help find car. I ask this. She absolute angel. She imagine letting stay parking lot look car. She's real MVP.** \- Years ago, bride abandoned NYC hook guy saw every night. I flown Cleveland visit I seen long time. But even walk subway make sure I safely, even though I asked I uncomfortable walking alone. \- **I leave without saying word.** After girls back cruise, I I going go home least dramatic way possible. I I stressed car situation I mood go out. That all. It drama-free. The bride understood. \- When I home, texted see I made home safely. **The following morning (around 11:30 AM), girl helped find car texted privately make sure I home, super nice I really appreciated that.** 11:30 little late considering I drove night.I 3 bedroom home front backyard.

We catch monthly dinners provided cases state. One friends made beautiful paella fixed plates kitchen brought along garlic bread. When brought mine "I dished little less carbs," front everybody confused I watch carbs (triggers ED behaviour). I looked dish I half portion friend next had, slice garlic bread others 3 pieces. I thanked thinking I watch carbs I can full portion, I excited try food looked great. She asked I thought I eat full meal, I looking good (losing weight) lately ruin progress. I promised I happy regular serve. This issue portions slightly different, entree vs main size meal kind difference. When brought plate I thanked left it. After vibe weird still fun.

She's constantly cleaning, sterilizing organizing things around house. This issue relationship I constantly feel I'm walking eggshells around her. Her OCD tendencies gone overdrive ever since Robby born. Don't wrong, I'm happy diligent comes keeping home clean healthy. However, I feel become unhealthy, specifically regarding Robby. Robby cried several occasions friend group company over. He's rarely allowed visit friends, does, immediately shower head toe thoroughly. I've addressed issues Jen, refuses see Robby's point view. The incident: Yesterday, Robby, Jen home. Jen finished cleaning carpet livingroom went clean bathroom. Robby wanted glass milk, poured glass went livingroom watch TV. At point, Robby accidentally knocked glass, spilled milk onto carpet. I bedroom, next thing I know, I hear Jen screaming top lungs. I rush livingroom see Jen screaming Robby cries corner. He looked terrified, kept frantically apologizing shaking. Jen screamed, "I JUST FUCKING CLEANED THIS CARPET! WHY DIDN'T YOU DRINK THE MILK IN THE KITCHEN?!" I stepped Jen calm down, little milk, big deal. She continued yell nonstop started aggressively cleaning milk cussing Robby breath. I Robby go room Jen I talk alone. After left, I Jen screamed Robby that. She defended saying knew rules should've known better. I little boy made mistake anyone could've made. After things continued escalate, I realized getting her. I yelled, "Robby I sick tired BS. Robby even kid constantly terrified you. I'm gonna sit back let Robby anymore. You're fucking crazy!!" She dead silent went back mindlessly cleaning carpet. I spoke Robby eventually calmed taking ice cream. After back ice cream, I saw Jen locked spare bedroom. She refuses acknowledge spoken since yesterday. For first years, I saw go whole night morning without cleaning. I'm starting feel I went far, I trying defend son. AITA?Hi, long lurker, first poster. I (f31) recently bought first home own! I'm super happy it, encounter new neighbor earlier today kind threw groove, now I'm wondering I've asshole. Basically, I call goth, style similar. Corporate goth, I guess say? Lots black, I use color personal life tends dark shades. When I house hunting I pay much attention paint color anything, searched house fit needs/ budget/ etc. And I found it, good commute work quiet neighborhood. It bright yellow blue shutters/doors bright flowers yard, I knew I paint it. I bit left lease, I moved I house pained pale, warm shade gray black trim white shutters/doors, flowers replaced ones better fit color scheme, added dark leaf plum tree front yard. Anyway, days since I moved I yard older woman came started asking I this, I need make house "witchey" (?) dark. She I ruined look whole neighborhood going bring property values. I away property starting yell, went inside. Later I started wonder. It's house looks nice me, houses colorful mine stands lot. I think will sink property values, clash lot. AITA? Edit: I feel I clarify- I personally identify witch (I'm atheist), house looked like. But thank support.My husband I take shoes house. Every mother-in-law visited house found way walk house shoes. She forgetting--she making conscious decisions (I go detail, forgetfulness). The last house 2 years ago Thanksgiving. She purposefully walked living room shoes. She back house due pandemic, even COVID I adamant husband I serious discussion come again. The in-laws come Thanksgiving year. I sent message reiterating need follow house rule will meeting hotels AirBnBs now on. Here's excerpt (included since tone important): "I remind everyone take shoes house. No exceptions. That means every single time, wear shoes outside, shoes inside. I will chair door can sit put shoes on. 99% guests respect rule, I hope I can stress-free Thanksgiving knowing guests respect house rule I ask follow. Last Thanksgiving hosted, I felt I constantly vigilant, stressful means I enjoy holiday in-law family. I hope peaceful, stress-free holiday, can continue invite guests home. If not, will need meet people wear shoes home Air BnBs hotels, home." They husband feel unwelcome now. Husband brother-in-law say I abrasive aggressive. I genuinely trying assert house rules without mean. I struggle expressing I respectful relationship MIL. AITA? Edit: It's hours day. They drive 2 days visit us, stay us several days Thanksgiving. She medical issue prohibits taking shoes. I medical issues. I reminded repeatedly 13 years, I watch 24/7. She enjoys sneaking ways walk house sneakers on, outside socks dthen wear socks inside ("What? I shoes on."). Yes husband brought up. Why I relationship her? Because family? Some people even divorce this. Wow. Second edit: UPDATE. After I work I called in-laws. MIL picked up, wanted talk kid address issue, handed phone FIL I talked it. He said, "She's kind person sometimes going tell her, sometimes going ... forget." I said, "I'm hearing 'Sorry happen again', hotel AirBnB Thanksgiving." He excited AirBnB--we affordable cabin woods. We're going meet there. It's definitely expensive, I will much better I care wears shoes AirBnB (unless house rule there!).My (36m) ex-wife (35f) 2 kids (7f) (6m). We divorced 3 years now happily remarried. We bad spouses, now decent friend good parents. My ex-wife primary custody currently I every weekend 2-3 evenings week. It also helps wife (38f) I live miles away next town. Since divorce, ex-wife SAHM husband (36m) good job making \~$120k. I good job make \~$150k/year wife always breadwinner recently received sizable promotion/raise $280k/year. I've always wanted go back school, work schedule I never able it. My wife I talking thinks I quit job, go back school, house husband. She already made joke getting French maid outfit... hahaha. Seriously though, allow us spend kids too. We've going weeks talking though reduce income, retirement savings, effect marriage, etc. We also talked logistically kids too. Luckily since live close kids school, easy school drop offs pick ups I 50/50 arrangement. Here's concern. Since ex-wife SAHM I kept working, I paying $2,000/month. If I quit job went 50/50 custody, I think fair go back court child support reduced zero since neither us working 50/50. I talked ex-wife first onboard I brought child support. She blew calling selfish thinking since I good job, I need keep it. I fight I hung up, now I'm second guessing everything. AITA wanting quit job house husband go court 50/50 visitation remove child support? Edit 1: My ex-wife I split kid related expenses covered health insurance since birth. I offered continue paying coverage. Well, wife's plan, still... Edit 2: As mentioned above, live miles away ex-wife husband. Nothing changes kids education, sports, friends, favorite donut shop, etc. Edit 3: My ex-wife successful real-estate agent making $100k/year. She chose SAHM re-married. Edit 4: I will course consult attorney taking actions. Edit 5: I feel important add note arrived $2000/month child support. Wen divorced earning \~$140k/year ex-wife earning \~$100/year. She live house refinanced house paid out. The CA Child Support & Spousal Support calculator gave guideline \~$1350/month CS \~$100/month SS. When went mediation, requested $2,000 since going expense new 3 bedroom house. I agreed increased amount money. Even married ex-wife husband bought house, never went back lower monthly payments. \*\*\*UPDATE 12/2/21: We ex-wife husband dinner last night (something usually month) talk everything through. I explained position reasons behind plans. My ex-wife husband understanding everything, ok reduction child support principle, unsure much. We seemed stuck "put pin it" went polite conversation kids Tennis holding middle finger China, etc. After glasses wine, I probed asked used $2,000/month anyway. My ex-wife let slip husband "saving" child support money payment new house. I react moved conversation. They currently live pretty nice 4bed/3bath \~2500 sqft house.Hey guys kind silly she’s really mad me. My (29F) sister (35f) recently baby girl baby came still sac doctor rip open little let baby out. It really cool see everyone happy healthy. We seeing baby days later talking “birthing experience” I joking technically laid egg. Well, sister didn’t find funny “I’m fucking chicken” still mad me.

But back covid restrictions, course, unseasonably warm season (thanks global warming?) lot dance will taking place outside. Anyway, boys supposed ask girls, yesterday lunch, boy asked I agreed go him. My dad always traditional kind guy comes younger sister (14F). So last night dinner, I mentioned I date dance, made crack answering door shotgun. The thing is, I'm pretty sure it. I going that, I'd meet friend group school. He serious angry tone sneaking around guy without knowledge. He asked I even knew guy. He turn "slutty girls" give away first guy meet self-respecting man ever marry. That's I flipped switch. I think I'm pretty good kid. I good grades, I play volleyball, I help sister homework help drive soccer practice, I've never boyfriend. So talked I lovestruck idiot going wind pregnant I'm choosing go dance friend really annoyed me. Also, I bit dad's history. He frat college, stories cousin (18M), recently started college big state school frat culture big thing. So I that: a) guy friend seems nice, turns dick I'll figure b) I agreed go dance. The last I checked, going dance binding sexual contract. And I may crossed line. I I knew frat college, I goes places. I also stories cousin. So heat moment, I something along lines of: "By logic, slut family **you.**" Then I looked mom "you must self-respect married him." By looks faces, I tell I hurtful. And course, I yelled probably able go dance all. But I feel unfair give lecture "slutty" behavior self-worth recently bragging male cousin MUCH worse things years older me. But maybe I crossed line trying prove point. AITA? &#x200B; **UPDATE:** oh god oh fuck oh god oh fuck. I it. I came out, I spite. I picked whole god damn bouquet whoopsie-daisies. To clear, I I comments I sure I guys, kind I figured I experiment men obligation deciding sexuality. But dad talked whole pregnancy thing last night I thought it, I realized far realm interest. And I've crushes girls, although hard admit myself. It's super duper ok family. So I took comments saying I need apologize mom heart, I realized y'all right - deserve that. I made omelette coffee brought bed sat bed talk happened. My dad house. I explained I I last night anger, I hurt horrible accusations thrown I feel I've given reason doubt judgement. I apologized line attack I angry at. And I feel dad really see valuable person believes I'm smart enough take decisions seriously, I make mistake, I worth anything anyone. I cried, hurtful. She understood starting talk, dad walked in. Keep mind, I still angry him. And walked whole scene something nasty. He saw I crying "oh, hormones, looks someone's pregnant already." The look face joke. But I hated it. My mind went mean girl overdrive. Granted, I smart. But I done. So I said, "Good news, I think sex men getting pregnant something ever worry about". He looked me. I looked him. He looked me. I looked him. It clicked. Now drive whole house quiet. I'm kind hiding room. Oops. &#x200B;I (30m) plant-based diet 10 years health reasons. I take supplements regular checkups doctor monitor health. So far, I problems diet. A week half ago, sister (32f) asked I favor taking care nephews (13m 15f) week, since husband going vacation. Honestly, I kind wary it, since sister history specific people take care children, I still agreed. She knows diet, I sent message "Do nephews eat meat? If so, give money I can go buy I need I can cook them?" , I reply, I assumed okay nephews ate way I did. They left me, really good week. In personal opinion, nephews ate healthy nutrients (except absence protein), kids plenty energy loved cooking, I think problem diet. EDIT: I feed animal protein, I include plant (vegetal?) protein every meal (tofu, rice, seeds, beans, etc.) My nephews also really enjoyed I cooked, objetion part. I even made plans niece teach cook certain dishes really liked. Today, sister husband came pick nephews. My sister asked ate, niece ate me. My sister Angry capital A. She yelled I abused children, I right push lifestyle them, never left me, etc. When I asked respond message asking wanted nephews eat meat, replied obligation pay everything nephews wanted eat, implicit family eats meat, think necessary reply. In end, sister will never trust will tell whole family untrustworthy I am. Am I really AH?For context, I(37M) three kids (13M, 9F, 5F) two wife (38F), son step-kid her. house specific chore schedule works way us can chores still plenty free time/family top homework sports. It took look come system, allowance system, wife always iffy kids “too little” help, us giving allowance first place. We ended working oldest toddlers, it’s system several years. Yesterday, I came home early getting ready start dinner, I noticed daughter’s wife’s nails done full nice colors even nail extensions. The could’ve done chore time. Unless she’d gotten kids home school early (this impossible, kids school gives parent call they’re picked early.) she’d skipped chores. With strict wife whole thing, I heavily doubt she’d skip chores take thirty minutes nails. My daughter started talking much fun they’d had, I asked found it, slipped admitting brother chores. When I asked long went say since September. I went go ask wife, deflective saying daughter lied rushed chores day. Told I’d go ask son it, went daughter truly lying, we’d scold lie. Checked son, daughter right. He thought I change, talking brought Mom wouldn’t paid, since help work. I went right bag downstairs, wallet pulled entirety September’s money gave him. I I’d go bank October’s money full month, he’d worked deal this. My wife flipped out. She started argument directly front kids, much I tried calm talk privately wouldn’t budge. All shouting ended waking toddler napping throughout this, that’s finally stopped screaming match. She’s calling TA simply paying son without even talking her, chores much easy extra work make slacking, (note; downstairs bathroom toddler’s room. Neither easy.) slackers shouldn’t paid. To prevent fights I compromised, letting problem go son keep money figure whole thing out. We’re keeping peace Halloween, haven’t talked all.Not really bowl easiest way describe it.

SIL 20 passed family already focused (no judgement, fact). In call found wanted move different city happened living near offered us live find place settled. We long convos finally decided short while. We paid rent living helped upkeep home, cooking. He feels indebted this. Im assuming it’s tapped abandonment issues regarding mother passing, fathering checking mentally happened, losing grandmother. OH may I add, daughter mentioned didn’t delivery room she’s “shy”. Which I think code for, mom sucks ass. EDIT: Hey everyone! We another ~extensive~ conversation two topics mentioned he: A. Apologized insensitive medical procedure birth, he’s fine even anyone come see baby day birth (because I explained since COVID I didn’t feel comfortable passing baby around rotisserie chicken). B.

My sister found engaged started begging bridesmaid. I no, receive invite. She blew phone I choosing friends family deserved bridesmaid. My parents called let sister bridesmaid. AITA letting sister bridesmaid?[removed]My brother Martin (M 36) wife Lea (F 32) daughter (F 5) Ivy. I huge problem food, I lactose gluten intolerant also I diet I diabetes.

Dried crap splattered bowel, bottom seat, BAD, I actually gagged. And I cleaned left, I especially pissed made effort correct situation. When I I grossed out, pretended left way, make sense eyes. I needs clean it, way I it, especially since I'd done hours before. He I'd done it, bathroom job. He bought dinner, refusing clean mess made ungrateful (although come back 3 week vacation I took care two kids dinner supposed thank that). Things escalated ended shouting "if clean will show really are" I even means. All I I feel situation reversed, I left mess problem deal with. So AITA chore I normally specific situation? I acknowledge normally job, I feel NOT normal situation! EDIT: reading comments thinking husband's patterns behavior, I bigger problem nuclear explosion toilet. This man wanted make sure kids Covid ruin 3 week trip (not like, DIE, anything). The person saw clearly grieving loss dear friend covid, called buzzkill I mood sex.

Since family Christian live country, usually end spending holidays family. He always lived large household everyone shares enthusiasm Christmas always makes fun. The problem now husband wants us host Christmas house next ok sure, clarified meant I gad host prepare dinner grunt work. Now idea goes Christmas. My family different religion childhood consist dad holidays never huge deal me. I dont stuff required. He already hosting Christmas mad can say without even asking? So clearly responsibility host Christmas family since really care way another now accusing ruining lifelong wish ended telling mother MIL SIL's blowing phone saying "grinch".

Its always really obvious favorite child parents treat differently me. His room twice size mine, gets money go friends eat I go I use money I saved birthday Christmas grandma visits, I trouble things trouble for, higher expectations me, parents need help something always ask him, stuff that. I've trying explain treated differently agree. They think head. I give examples brother always really grumpy barely speaks I'm bad mood barely speak *one day* I trouble. But different annoyed I tried explain why. My brother thing lately gets annoyed something (I think loses video game game freezes something I'm sure always room) starts swearing slamming hand desk, stomps around house slamming doors hour. This happens maybe week. It scares cat honestly scares too. But parents ignore it. He yesterday I holding cat arms shredded cat panicked. I asked mom gonna talk outbursts I ignore grow it.

So now I'm grounded swearing thumping hand desk once, brother slams doors stomps around house week never even stop. And still parents admit treat us differently. My dad even came later tell copying brother prove point acknowledge I actually make point, kept saying I immature. AITA? ETA uh I think lot people reading much maybe based experiences assumptions. My parents totally fine around *except* fact strict think I'm line brother. We along fine every time. Just hypocrites mean psychos. My brother autistic. He's recently gotten anger issues parents bothered anything it. He's even completely dependant them, cooks meals cleans room chores me.

I live relatively country, exactly common whole properties fenced, usually fences animals. Since nice out, ate lunch outside. Some food immediately brought inside ate, including deserts mostly chocolate, bit fruit. I figured food probably fine left little bit, thrown away. The food covered, too. After ate, went small pond property little bit(probably half hour/45 minutes). It nice dock view trees, great place spend time. When back food left, neighbors dog table, eating food, ripped covers off. I neighbors apologized, asked dog eaten. I them, food toxic dogs(chocolate, grapes, etc). They started freaking rushed dog vet. Yesterday contacted asked I pay vet bills. Their dog survived, needed extensive care wracked quite bit vet bills. I offered pay quarter bills, wanted it, food ate mine. I let dog property eaten food. They accidentally gotten mean to, I pay bills. I made remark pay food dog ate, amused upset. I quarter nothing, still upset pay more. I leave food out, though. AITA paying full cost?15 months ago, new wife wanted dog. I stepchildren longtime friends wife long history wanting dog anything world (she worst case ADHD I’ve ever seen adult), finding new home dog gets tired it. After long conversation, assured wouldn’t happen, I explained much I love dogs couldn’t make dog part family take away. She promised. Fast-forward months, newness wore affection grew (very small) dog. He’s perfect—even can’t consistently poop outside—but he’s happy, affectionate puppy. Without consulting first, wife spent $2,000 new dog (a whole issue) last summer. As interest new dog grew, disdain first dog also grew. She wants rid first dog. I’ve made part family, I’m now package deal includes him, he’s going nowhere. She thinks I’m asshole standing her. AITA? EDIT: Thank feedback, messages, awards. I started trying respond comments, many. My wife clearly asshole, I’m putting pieces place make ex wife. She gave word, I gave trust, abused it. I work home crate dogs I leave (since else house will lift finger them), I’m worried “accidentally” getting out, I sincerely think knows better physically abuse them. Her interest newer dog starting fade, I’m sure I leave (she owned house met), I’ll taking them. Since she’s impulse-shopped us close poverty, it’s going slow process getting funds together I walk door. She’s therapy takes casserole daily meds, although I’m certain she’s covert narcissist misidentifies empath, therapist can help she’s delusional, man ever going find prolonged happiness her. This shit I wish I’d known marrying her, live learn.[removed]Last night I went Walmart I can 24 pack truly $23ish. I checked issue, threw receipt way out.

He dish vegan, doesn’t meat dairy it. I that’s vegan food is. He getting increasingly angry finally “I didn’t make fucking vegan food. And ever come back, won’t fucking salad eat next time. Don’t ever come home calling vegan.” It meant compliment. Not insult. AITA? When little brother Teddy born, umbilical cord wrapped around neck. According mom, breathing least three minutes. Since parents often used excuse Teddy's behavior. My childhood became living hell Teddy. "Give Teddy candy! He died coming world" "Let play friends! He died coming world!" "Let open presents! Teddy almost birthday!" I put Teddy's tantrums, abuse, fits bad behavior. If I touched single hair head, I punished Teddy away whatever did. It became bad I 15, I moved house live family members away Teddy. My contact parents Teddy limited. Currently I'm 35 Teddy 26. When 18, decided wanted competitive eater turned eating. Teddy now weighs almost 600lbs. Cause weight, hold job lives parents still cater pay everything. Since Teddy requires round clock care, parents hardy leave house. They present wedding, see grandkids I bring around family events dinners held house cause hard move Teddy. A days ago Teddy suffered bad fall put hospital. My husband I least came see him. My parents complained hospital feeding enough, wheelchair big enough naturally hear anything weight. It easier turn water gold. To make long story short, parents pulled husband I aside asked large amount money Teddy's care. They money keep caring dip retirement funds. They even suggested Teddy cleared go home, move us cause husband I well bigger house "We can break cause care round visit." I no. My husband hell no! We work full time. Our kids enrolled sports dance. We made clear Teddy moving us moving schedule around deal giving money even though afford it. "He's brother! You almost brother!" We left hospital. My mom later called me, berating abandoning family Teddy demanding money. I I care Teddy circumstances. Even something happened dad, I care brother problem. Not mine. My mom cursed phone hung up.

Fed best) My issue arose came day asked take breast milk. She decided formula expensive take breast milk I pump. I no, I saving case baby girl issues latching I’m around needs fed. My sister freaked I didn’t need much I always pump giving I pumped far wouldn’t matter. We argued parents involved. Now it’s become whole family issue people disagree blowing phone. Am I unreasonable? A small edit gets much traction: sister decided breastfeed boobs sag. Not exactly relevant I figured someone might ask questionThrowaway: I (37F) little Sister named "Valerie" wonderful daughter named "Lucy." As Lucy entered teen years, become lot self conscious. She constantly compares friends school, celebrities, etc. I currently attending Therapy I also try best remind beautiful way is. Valerie took daughter Lucy Mall yesterday. When Lucy back home, I asked day went. She smiled good time. About three hrs later, I went Lucy's room put clothes away. When I opened door, I saw Lucy laying bed crying. I asked happened? She pulled phone showed pics Valerie posted social media. Valerie posted pics herself, daughter Lucy hanging Mall. Lucy pointed Valerie obviously photoshopped her. She made complexion clearer, teeth whiter even slimmed waist. Lucy also pointed Valerie photoshopped pics. Lucy dropped phone ground cried eyes out. Eventually, Lucy wanted alone while. I left went outside I ready unleash Valerie! I called demanded alter Lucy's image. She defensive said, "Last I checked, I post whatever I account." I crushed Lucy saw pics. Valerie doubled simply making Lucy look "better." I Lucy fine way I appreciate destroying Lucy's confidence. We kept yelling things continued escalate. Valerie yelled daughter around Lucy I'm "drama queen!" I yelled back, "Good. I daughter around dollar store Instagram slut anyway!" She go fuck myself, hung blocked everywhere. I mentioned conversation Lucy stressed enough already. My Husband says I went far I should've mature since I'm "big sister." AITA? EDIT: My insult directed towards Valerie called "drama queen."

I (32F) now 8 weeks pregnant third child. Nearly two weeks ago, sister (34F) went labour thirty weeks little boy unfortunately make it. It understandably really traumatic inconsolable. It made worse fact took four years conceive. I found I pregnant 6 weeks 3 days, couple days sister miscarried. I figured best tell soon put salt already gaping wound. My family trying. My morning sickness starting act couple days leading funeral, I never considered canceling I needed support sister time. The service went according plan, problems started happening wake, comprised entirety sister BIL's families friends BIL's parents house. My excuse drinking easy I'm teetotal without pregnant, difficult nausea hit. I excused bathroom, I promptly threw up. My brother's wife (SIL), best friends, followed up. She straight 'You're pregnant, you?' I responded, 'Yes, tell anyone. Today's making sis BIL comfortable.' My SIL congratulated understood. Unbeknownst me, BIL's teenage sister bedroom next bathroom, instead family proceeded spread news around wake I managed downstairs. My sister confronted crying asked true. I yes I mean find this. She screamed 'I conceive easier fucking rabbit (I admit true, something I caused bit pain kids 2 9 months) I flaunting pregnancy suffered.' It ended retreating bedroom screaming. It awful. Everyone thinks I'm AH, except husband SIL. My BIL refusing look eye, even I explained situation. He says I known sister room. My mum I easily SIL I caught bug daughters, I believe BIL's sister (who habit attention-seeking) spread rumours anyways, private conversation. My brother fighting SIL believes asked. I think I need unbiased opinion. So AITA? &#x200B; Edit: SIL I apologised upset caused, sister BIL forgiven incident (all three BIL's siblings right helped see attention seeker help past history pulling shit school family), decided keep distance pregnancy raw. I respect that, parties look forward meeting near future things feel settled. Overall, pretty positive.[removed]I really believe family friends split pretty much 50/50. While I think half think I’m TA don’t cats, it’s bothering me. I took cats vet yesterday yearly checkup. My vet relaxed restrictions it’s longer techs coming cat car, we’re now back sitting waiting room. He big cat overweight, something mix genes created large dude - 18.2 pounds. Due size, doesn’t fit carriers I cats I use older carrier smallish dog. This carrier used transport dog overseas *not* cargo, it’s TSA approved nicer average carrier. Little roomy, plastic, lots mesh visibility, quite cozy. The poor thing sit 8 hours, course wanted comfortable possible. But I said, it’s older. It scuff marks shows normal wear tear, it’s I carrying fresh sweatshop Prada handbag cat inside. There another woman waiting room cat large plastic kennel-sort unit, ones can unlatch separate top bottom halves, easily twice size carrier. I focused calming cat wasn’t really paying attention her, heard coughing clearing throat repeatedly I asked okay. She sort scoffed I must insecure I show vet’s office. I didn’t understand meant I shrugged. She however clarified, saying I ashamed flaunt wealth others hard even finding homes. Again, I idea talking I I’m anything that. She upset I’ve clearly never worked day life I wouldn’t understand feels working mother watch white trash bring designer cat carrier. I pissed carrier 6 years old, older cat inside it, even I didn’t benefit reusing something high quality I would’ve sure shit managed buy something comfortable stressed cat plastic bin she’s (there wasn’t even towel inside poor cat lay on). I may wealthy I least give shit pets. I called back reply. I low blow, I minding business mine. AITA?I'm currently living parents hubs gets rented place sorted, hopefully moving next days. We two toddlers little five months ago I emergency c section triplets. We lost sons two months old. Talking babies touchy subject, wpuld expect, I feel I'm getting much better. Pretty quick, "We triplets lost one," "We five kids angel baby," avoid awkward questions. I refuse talk son, much child four, always deserves mentioned. As talking family not, things can little awkward. I try correct anyone referred twins, even upset some. Anyway, tensions high, I've started packing things, ready leave - parents getting pissy, whatever. My mom made comment four children, I snapped I five kids, remember that. My sister involved, essentially "give triplet dream" I make everyone uncomfortable I mention him. I pretty inconsolable, delved fight I'd kids upstairs. It wasnt long - maybe ten minutes, I leave kids unsupervised - ten minutes I called cold hearted bitch, never understand suffering losing child. She called dramatic, parents I didnt calm forced kick out, I went upstairs. I ended calling husband breaking quarantine god I need comfort. First seen person five weeks. That three days ago. Everything ten times awkward, sister still acting upset I hurt feelings. Parents tossed two hundred ounces pumped milk really iced cake. I'm treated reaction unwarranted. She basically dead baby unimportant, I'm treated kind monster insulting her. I apologised keep peace, improved much. Was I really shitty?My husband hard working mornings. He sets ridiculous amount alarms root common petty arguments. He will set 5min intervals 1 whole hour. If trying 7:30am, alarm will start 6:30am go every 5mins. And takes snooze. It's miserable me. I go work 5am days, days I able shift schedule 7:30am. So days, I look forward able sleep little longer. Obviously I obnoxious alarm going every 5 mins. It's loud days I sleep I work, alarm will wake baby room means I 7am rare days off. I begged try harder, I've offered compromise, I asked shift alarm maybe 30mins I can extra 30min shut eye. He's convinced wake much alarms. Some days completely miss wake late work plays games phone night will fall asleep, forget charge phone! Today, I decided I going take longer. It waa day sleep 7:30am, alarms started 6:30. Again 6:35. Another 6:40. At 6:45, I turned lights yelled leave. He startled, asking why? It's still early. I said, gonna set alarms early, going leave early. I ridiculous everyone around needs suffer better sleep schedule. He started saying "well I guess I'll set alarms keep getting late I'll fired". He stormed went work now really upset work hour earlier here.I'm 22f, I 3 daughter homeless. I lost job home beginning pandemic. I since found alternative employment. We streets, living hotel. The problem coming deposit, pretty much everywhere requires first two months rent, last month deposit. That coupled grand month rent area, proving difficult come deposit. My sister keeps offering take daughter room stay every single time, I refused. In hotel, daughter privacy curtain beds, visual privacy also move aunt. Recently, parents found sisters offer really pissed I accept, called child services twice, found issue current situation since illegal homeless child. My daughter everything needs except back garden run around child services fine that. My parents still think I accept sisters offer provide daughter room think I'm major asshole so. I really think I'm asshole since daughter also go. AITA? ETA: My sister wants cover daughters expenses goes thereI(27f) live roommate(J)(30f). I house helps bills stuff. J seizures anxiety. She takes medicine always work really bad doesn't. She recently went doctor recommended service dog alert seizures deep pressure therapy. Over weekend brought doctor her.

I can take medicine dog hair everywhere it'll make better it'll still uncomfortable. I that, known moved in. She non allergenic dog poodle goldendoodle. I still allergies those. It's better, still pretty bad and, again, medicine completely help. I gotten far without one, either come inside move out. J unfair afford move anywhere else, something possibly life threatening compared discomfort. She made decision yet family asked friends them. They think I'm asshole threatening kick nowhere go, getting dog cause allergies anyway. J also pretty upset this. I'm starting think I let dog take allergies pills mild discomfort I know. Am I Asshole saying stay service dog?Edited clarify: 1) Ava child free (according Theo 2) I’m pro choice problems women choosing abortion, it’s something Barry I don’t personally agree In lives…… I apologise making long post.

Theo pretty serious relationship months ago I never met I suggested dinner party invite friends well. Ava (23F) seemed sweet first I noticed seemed cold towards me. I thought Barry asked well. I thought may hard surrounded new people I make big deal it. We sat dinner Ava asked pregnancy going. I thanked asking alright. I steered conversation another topic I topic night. It alright onwards while. Ava seemed along well everyone. I feeling bit tired I excused went cold drink. When I came back friends making sure I okay asked wrap party early I no. Ava made comment pregnancy hard I agreed saying hardest thing ever. She "No offence fuck guys consider abortion" laughing. I felt awkward thing ask...no really answered Barry something do. He asked everyone needed drinks, attempt change topic Ava continued. She (something along lines of) "You guys ruining life right yikes" still laughing.. So I her, bit rudely, please say things since I feeling uncomfortable. She replied saying brutally honest people liked her. I thinking, I met girl. I deal rest night I "please maybe learn manners" I guess expect say out. Theo angry me, I ruining left her. After awkward moments friends supported decision good night. Yesterday Theo messaged (for first incident) Ava refusing speak "thanks I hope happy". Idk specific sentence made feel guilty. I believe I may asshole, new member group maybe I overreacting mean insult me. Barry thinks otherwise may biased so. Hello everyone!, I f32 fiance Kevin m37 3 years. I'm 4 months pregnant stepson (Teddy) 9yo live Kevin's house. I work provide Kevin's unemployed. I recently given different position company now I work home problem office; Only 3 rooms. Our bedroom + Teddy's bedroom + Teddy's playroom. I need private space work I asked Kevin I use Teddy's playroom no. I asked means even I begged. Last week, I admittedly fed tv noises working livingroom decided I going move Teddy's toys bedroom turn playroom office. I organized everything Kevin came home lost control nerves argument I never done that. He I needed understand house every room belongs I never overstepped taken Teddy's playroom "kicked' - I agreed points.

He demanded I put everything back I sorry no. He I attitude look good step mom, Called selfish go explain Teddy I problem stealing room refusing give back surprised begins resenting even agrees let it. I understand Kevin always protective son puts first many dads even chose partner based close I son issue basically caused rift us.My brother wife first baby 7 months ago. My mother lives recently started watching baby instead placing daycare. So baby house week. It’s month mom says baby barely sleeps. Will cry show signs tiredness, naps half hour most. My brother SIL also us baby still wakes almost every 1-2 hours throughout night newborn it’s extremely exhausting. They’ve tried plenty different things nothing improved much. The baby drinks breast milk. While I EVERY baby different, works might others, I still can’t help think aren’t feeding baby enough. As mother 3 myself, kids started differently (one ate baby cereal 4 months, another didn’t take solids 6m) I think I good sense baby ready start taking more. After finding feed baby 4 oz time, I suggested talking pediatrician starting Baby solids. They Dr. already gave go ahead bro/Sil didn’t think baby ready yet. So I I think upping ounces milk probably help Baby sleep better. Fuller = longer stretches. They brushed off. Then last Friday mom watching baby decided give baby smashed banana. Which baby absolutely loved. My Sil pissed obviously I can see why. It wasn’t mother’s call make numerous reasons. But mom wouldn’t back saying starving grandchild. So called basically demanded I middle make mom apologize wouldn’t see baby anymore. I I think apologize getting permission I don’t think mother wrong reasoning. That aren’t feeding child enough maybe they’re new parents, hear parents out. They called choice words don’t feel comfortable leaving child house anymore apologize. I I wouldn’t give baby anything didn’t I will NOT apologize voicing opinion. Am I asshole apologizing keeping opinions myself? Now mother I might see baby foreseeable future. Edit slight update: I see lot “call CPS”. Neither mom I think involving CPS appropriate. We parents LOVE baby worried giving Baby wrong thing. Baby regular checkups doesn’t seem misses meal.

However I doubting judgment. Am I petty anger? AITA paying 50% rent? &#x200B; Edit: This come many times -why I tell BF ahead I going pay 50% normal. The answer I never thought money I went transfer money monthly bills. That first I realized I financially supporting brother I kept paying 50% I decided I going it. &#x200B; Edit 2: I decided many people pointed unfair give BF notice I going paying less good point. I transferred rest money earlier today. I next month I paying 25% rent/ 33% utilities - notice now. No excuses next month brother still (and will be). Update: BF's brother moved out. I will moving soon BF finds replacement end March - ever happens first. BF's brother end moving day deadline. I'll admit I really surprised - I expect to. I happy, though pretty clear BF not. Three days later BF wanted put lease apartment. When I first moved worth effort cost that. I asked changed mind thought good idea. I kept probing finally admitted uneasy I move leave hanging rent. Which, honestly, fair. However fact I lease let set boundary allowing brother move in. I I sign added lease 2 ones allowed live apartment. BF refused - saying necessary. That reason drag landlord argument. At point kinds warning noises went head. I I refused unless added. I going stuck paying rent moved brother back in. We argued. A lot. I accused planning moving brother back soon I signed lease. He denied way - I believe him. At point I realized going work out. Whether I "paranoid" (BF's word) BF moving brother back - shows I trust him. And relationship without trust. I over. I going bail him. The lease end end March anyway. I will move then. If wants move sooner - I will so. If moves brother - I will move immediately. We moved stuff bedroom - sleeping room. BF looking new roommate. That wants done soon possible since I "don't care family". &#x200B;[deleted][deleted]My SO(F 35) I (M 33) couch watching show Netflix scene came two step siblings squabling using others' razor.

My son 5, husband + I late 30s. Our parents late 60s. We enjoying drinks, waiting food FIL waved waitress (not serving us) leaned in, whispered ear, “Can I pay compliment? I love hair, looks beautiful.” She thanks went back work. For additional context white waitress black. I felt shocked pissed woman work, also front wife grandson!

He also I 18 harassed men 3x age work I enjoyed attention happy I beautiful men noticed me. FIL I gotten debates before. Our outlooks life somewhat similar different enough conversations interesting. But took personally probably behavior. Instead leaving “I disagree” “let’s agree disagree” “I right. I’ve never right. I make everyone around happy. You wrong whole generation needs shut up.” Reasons I think husband I might assholes: His private conversations none business. I think hurt feelings I’m happy that. Perhaps gentle tactful.I 15 old son. As present getting A’s last report card, I saved money upgraded phone old iPhone 5s iPhone SE 2020. Yesterday came phone broken. I assuming dropped cracked screen, relatively easy expensive repair preform myself. But showed phone shattered, also bent, half screen hanging off.

He still needed something I use contact him, though, I gave old flip phone I found cabinet. He unusable completely unfair stick with, I disagree. It preforms basic actions need phone for. The rest optional, chose looking cool that. AITA?I've applying jobs recently. This morning boyfriend "Ian" still sleeping phone rang. It jobs I applied asked I minute talk. I sure went office shut door, I living room anyways noise carries living room I trying quiet. Well right I closed office door Ian I heard walking around. Then opened door came in. He asked "who that?" "Oh! Is mom? Tell hi". I still talking hr person "Is Mary? Who that?" I waved arm (trying wave away) still trying answer HR person's questions, went back living room. He followed "is Kim? Ask Kyle go lunch us later". So I went kitchen instead, followed AGAIN started unloading dishwasher. I started walking back office HR lady wanted come interview Thursday one.

You mean it." He's done crap annoying. So I stayed office checking emails futzing around. I'm irritated Hr person heard I looked unprofessional disrupting concentration (I Adhd) made harder focus saying. Maybe I snapped I overreacted. AITAI recently spent $2300 pocket getting assessed autism ADHD suggestion psychologist. I diagnosed both, allowed financial assistance accommodations uni, useful long term huge blow financially. When I mentioned parents I'd diagnosed, completely unnecessary I already diagnosed age 6. They never anyone else diagnoses think I different treated differently. Spoiler: I already knew I different, I thought I freak, every school bully even teachers. They even put ADHD meds didn't. So I asked parents reimburse money I wasted getting assessed, fault I wasted it. If kept medical information me, never happened I able accommodations start uni made things much easier me. They watched struggle socially academically 14 years never bothered explain help it. My family pissed asking reimbursed. They think rude parents anything wrong, trying protect me. They even keep saying autism stops understanding asking reimbursement rude. I think reasonable someone's actions caused waste money pay it. They 14 years tell me, I kid sat I 18 me, chose withhold medical information me. I (female-American 37) met fiancè (Male 46 Canadian-Lebanese) 3 years ago. He 23yo daughter "Najwa" She heavily parents separating I nothing cause I met 2 years separation.

He insisted I let go cause wants wedding RO will prevent there. He I already paid dress apologize I wanted I still refused. He least wait wedding whatever cause really wants Najwa called cruel dismiss important him. It much I I could've made things worse charged I stay away asked respect decision. I unreasonable think support begged I reconsider cause will ruin relationship forever. I feel morally I wrong since stepdaughter family I think might ruin relationship us (her, dad, inlaws).

At lived small, cramped 2 bedroom apartment- 2nd bedroom converted office I work home need space employment equipment (two monitors, printer, fax, filing cabinets, etc). Despite saying I truly didnt give space, begged pleaded finally I gave in. He said, I quote, "When day comes I family ever needed it." I honestly still far, far happy realistically speaking mom didnt need place go all. The house BF fact owned years move beyond (it wasnt toxic relationship- wasnt "feeling it" anymore). Fast forward two months staying: completely taken office space I equipment set spot available; directly front tv. She moves back BF. Never paid dime didnt even bother taking shit her- took 3 days clear fiance. Not impressed. Anywho- upgrade. We bought 4 bedroom home last plan expanding family. This prior finding fertile. It sucks honestly, is. I'm wildly upset it. However, mom lost home due foreclosure (she renting landlord didnt pay rent house foreclosed given 3 day notice quit). My mom siblings (14yo twins). Very well behaved clean kids. She needs place go. We two rooms available. I bring fiance immediately says isnt comfortable doesnt home feel isnt allowing people move "take over". So I brought agreement years back stated I allowed mother move literally reason; whereas mother legit needs place. He now saying years ago situation 100% different "there wasnt two teenagers running house" mom moved in. He says I'm AH trying force make something isnt comfortable with. AITA?BG info : I’m 21 brother Luke 18. I always protective brother. He accident baby parents made sure knew wasn’t wanted. We opposite, I sport outgoing, shy introvert. So always criticised him, compared us everything never good enough. Because Luke withdrawn around parents family. For friends, group 4. I met I 6 10. We became inseparable since quickly took role big brother Luke. So childhood always me, friends Luke. We taking care him, driving him, cheering competions, helping homeworks… Things changed friends started university. We less present. With Covid school closed competions stoped. He alone home parents really hard mentally. This september I took appartment friends changed city. 1 month ago Luke came night tears. He came parents night 18 birthday, went badly. They awful things still everyday. Apparently will accept decided date girl avoid shame. They also I never accept never now. I never saw brother depressed. That night I everything friends. The next day 3 us move adament pay rent anything. He home classes, everything good I can see getting happier everyday. Now issue : I GF 4 months ago since Luke came living us complains : I close him, always here,always sad..(she says front him). I stop roomates still I another room. 2 days ago us watching movie Luke working table next us. She suddently started talking dream wedding point : « Luke come wedding will bring woman date, 2 men together pretty pictures. You will date girl it’s hard ». Luke heard I saw face crumbled. I imediatly asked leave I speak next day. I spent night reconforting Luke. During evening texted rommates welcome anymore. The next day I talked joke, Luke sensitive.

Anyway thank messages support kind words means lot us.Throwaway BIL Reddit. I diagnosed terminal illness months ago. It’s matter if, when, best estimate I neighborhood 1-2 years. I’m dealing it. I’ve good life regrets. Part dealing getting affairs order I leave stage. My sister two children (13f & 5m). The 13 yo previous relationship, 5 yo current husband. My niece’s father skipped sister rough it, I helped early on. Her husband well they’re set now, it’s become obvious years wishes niece weren’t lives. They don’t exactly neglect her, she’s left lot it’s obvious even parents nephew heavily favored. I’ve talked sister various points, she’s denial I don’t think ever courage stand husband. I’ve tried make niece quiet ways, I still hurts I worry her. I made fortunate business moves early I’m now sitting large chunk change retirement fund I will live use. My sister made plans niece’s college anything else, girl incredibly smart hardworking school deserves chance make herself. It’s intention everything put trust death, managed executor she’s 25 parents can’t touch it, can money school, mature fully control. My nephew already trust fund father, doesn’t need money. Ironically, put better financial position rest family, I think that’s justice point considering much she’s put missed on. I sat parents sister lay plans end life wishes, sister deeply offended I’m excluding nephew. She thinks I leave money split set equal trusts kids. My father loathes BIL agrees letting sister near trust, I leave nephew something save face. My mother distraught opinion right now. BIL made joke later contesting will, sister isn’t speaking me. I feel I responsibility look niece since else is, brother will okay. I love nephew, too, though, don’t feel bad he’s older. I’ve planned leave non monetary items. AITA? Edit: Goodness, blew up! First, thank kind condolences. It’s never easy thing face, worse things can happen I’ve already fortunate most. As everyone suggested, I good lawyer financial planner working well trusted friend estate planning will executor remains far outside family politics possible. I idea someone suggested leaving enough university tuition locked nephew case father dishonest trust, I will discuss professionals. I’m also leaving items actual value, I suppose sell chose. That said, large family father’s side help him, whereas niece parents locally, family lives abroad position help. I also idea making recordings letters explain situation. Some worried BIL treating niece badly next years trust that’s something I’ve concerned myself. My niece prefer live grandparents happy her, sister obstacle appearances. I’ve compiled evidence emotional neglect years along BIL’s shady behavior general discussed suing custody parents event situation worsens. I will work emergency funds legal costs event happens allow niece emancipate 16 chooses. That two gap might difficult her, I think it’s clear lot eyes situation people corner, BIL won’t escalate much draw unwanted attention activities. Before I diagnosed, I floated idea sister paying send good boarding school better quality education maybe feel little comfortable away home. That received favorably time, may also option sister still open it. My parents I plan sit niece soon discuss her, make sure she’s introduced executor lawyer knows can reach needs help advice, prepare what’s coming. I planned trip us - sister nephew included - back parents’ home country Lunar New Year, I’m hoping I’m still healthy enough go can worked sister away BIL’s influence.[removed]I've never used reddit really works son wanted post unbiased opinions. My son married years ago first child 9 months ago. I usually people house Christmas son since now baby will traveling anywhere Christmas day. That's fine I nice Christmas.

My sister thinks he’s dramatic tells needs overcome “phase” even though it’s true issue. Recently he’s taken neurological test wasn’t developing right speed I guess? I’m entire sure. Anyway test determined something wrong took X-ray something saw mass brain. He needs MRI. Flash forward two days ago. My sister (34F) asks go support. Obviously I’m it. We drive hour place, nephew miserable car seat dealing quietly playing iPad. I ask sister explained what’s happening (mentally prepare enclosed machine 45 minutes). She he’ll fine.

She shrugged says they’ll “knock ass moves much” I tell won’t happen need test anesthesia allergies, etc. It’s quiet drive arrive, predicted, nephew mental breakdown try put MRI machine. He’s sobbing, shaking, sweating trying hide behind trash can. He terrified wet himself. It honestly broke heart. My sister incredibly mean this. She didn’t reassure comfort him. She grabbed tried force onto bed made scream “please God, protect me” cried. At end it, doctors proceed MRI settle down. We left In car, sister RIPPED into. “Why stupid” “you wasted nothing” “are happy now” “you can say goodbye things” He cried exhaustion I silently fumed fully asleep. Then I ripped whole fault talking process knowing he’s claustrophobic even wasn’t MRI scary children even adults. I mean acting cruel son. She bursted tears saying stressed couldn’t help it. I it’s job parent keep together son, take frustrations he’s also scared (he’s asked going die mass brain) After dropped off, sent long text calling AH saying she’s mean bad mom since I don’t kids I wouldn’t understand struggle.

I couldn’t explain prepare sister wouldn’t tell “scare even happens” The reason I didn’t say anything car yelled everyone never call parent front child.

He frustrated since I gave birth lot opinions doctors start bottle feeding. Most wait 3 month wait month I understood confused/frustrated. But saw easier also can feed baby too. I wanna clear something. My husband champ taking care working (from home) cooks, clean takes I need nap exchange I take “nightshift” energy work helping day. He also scared bonding I explained bonding even tho breastfeed directly I exclusively latching baby boob. And can see goes along road. I scared milk stopping I latch now I’ve read lot experience exclusively bottle feed pumping months. I’m gonna try weeks bottle night/breast day I’m still uncomfortable boob feeding I will pump bottle rest it. Also baby high palate creates vacuum sucky ion becomes painful. The nipple guard helps pain getting baby pushing away. Around 10 days ago I gave birth first baby. Since I exclusively breastfed. But annoyance gutted hell. I help nipple guard helped somehow pain completely. Still better though I still fed baby accordingly 2-3 hrs window satisfied. I asked alternatives since I’m producing much better breastfeed now I don’t mastitis. No bottle now. It still hurt I asked pediatrician “let’s see she/he gains looses weight first.” This week found baby actually back birthweight going up. Which good news. So I asked I bottle feed green light. My husband knows hurts also seen breastfeed hr (my baby normally goes 20-30min session). But thrilled I wanna bottle feed Last night I pumped around 3.0-3 1/2 oz. And fed baby, I finished (burping, changing diaper, swaddling) less 30 min. Baby cry asleep right away. I finally slept better 1-2hrs feeding night. My husband works I take care baby night try bother. This morning (around 5/6 am) saw bottle fed commented “so going use bottle now ha?” Angrily. I mostly night finally sleep without fuss.

But faux pas offer let wear without giving her? I happy big day literally necklace I grandma. AITA, Reddit? Edit: sister searching Reddit last night prove right borrowed jewelry instead found post.

English first language I suck it. My(28F) brother Mike (33M) married Lisa (31F) 4 years last caught cheating Penny(29F). My ex-SIL reserved, sweet straight edge (no alcohol/drugs). Mike loves party went court ordered rehab even 21. When Mike met Lisa sobered up, apprenticeship really turned life around. He also threw away Penny. Penny knew married, shit faced affair started. Penny loud, disgusting, obnoxious encourages brother drink, thinks soooo fun 'the life party'. We family party past weekend Mike Penny there. Some cousins seen years introduced Penny. Mike introduced "upgrade". Cue major side eye me, brother noticed pulled aside later. He asked attitude-Penny clearly 'upgrade'. I asked explain comment, She's blonde, curvy fun whereas Lisa "looked librarian tits". I decided clear things him. Penny obnoxious, rude, slovenly, hair poorly bleached smells fungus. No looks prize won. No jealous (which thinks are? His best friend even talk Penny made dead baby joke wife miscarriage) I let actually chose alcohol ex, Penny encouraged crush years. He called bitch, I "samesies". Pretty sure I asshole tbh Edit. Pretty disappointed going looks though-felt immature fact. Going silently judge brothers choices afar now (and saying I need accept brothers partner...lol I don't)? I involved. I really love SIL I really treated. And followed me, lol why? I roller coaster (I guess can consider that), water rides tracks pull it. Anyways, boat fits 6 people it, I family 5. I back, going top, asked duck going straight will photo wanted family photo. I'm sure rules, I think I would've safe it, I really I felt I duck I no. The parents kept arguing telling duck can family photo called spoilt brat, I go fuck started going down. This I may asshole, I flipped camera made funny face tongue out. Holy shit looked photos livid, saying I ruined opportunity nice family photo. They asked parents I lost. Their kids laughing asses off. I'm sure bought photos not. THe dude operated photos I immature I need grow My eldest daughter snotty attitude towards ever since first child, 10 years ago. She convinced start knows exactly she’s doing, needs help. I learned quickly keep unsolicited commentary myself. Except me, it’s different story they’re roof. I don’t think rules change accommodate & grandkids. For example, house kids grew in. I’ve rule since born: shoes carpet. And yet, daughter tells children, right front I’m encouraging take shoes off, ignore go ahead inside. I put arm stop grandkids no, that’s we’re this. My daughter dramatically huffed & puffed finally went along it. Until next day. We good amount snow ground course kids went enjoy that. So imagine shock I hear front door find eldest grandchild, 10 years old, couch snowy, muddy, dripping boots muddy prints across carpet. I SO angry. Is old enough better??? I go back right now take can help clean prints. He actually apologized agreeable, mom came cleaning mad. Her child business scrubbing floors “handling cleaning products” (it spot remover gloves). I made acceptable disrespect rules result. She mumbled something breath left. The last straw came last night. We watching movie together 8 old went bathroom 30 minutes later, I realized hadn’t returned. I went check found ruined half Christmas Eve dinner I prepared advance. He says he’d accidentally dropped stuffing (which he’d poorly cleaned up, half floor half trash can) “snack” consisted mac & cheese yams. We’d dinner 3 hours ago. I upset I almost tears. I sent guest room he’s staying daughter look did. What take away it? That I sent room. She, always, reminded I’m parent right tell do. I someone needed he’d single handedly ruined holiday dinner ridiculous. She snapped I’m “an old hag trying stay relevant.” I refused tolerate disrespect leave, kids packed up, 8 o’clock night, left. Now are, Christmas Eve morning, empty house. My husband angry causing leave says it’s days, I should’ve let go. Is right? I wish kids still here.**Thanks everyone comments. I greatly appreciate it** I majority housework, I’m okay this. I genuinely don’t mind it. My issue wanting help him. It I felt didn’t appreciate it. I’m nurse who’s working shifts longer usual (no biggie). So I home lot dishes sink since I’ve wanted shower sleep I home past days. And husband says, “I’m sure you’ve waiting dishes themselves, spoiler alert, they’re going to”. I “no aren’t, better em”. He laughed moved on. I went shower, came back dishes. He says there’s something needs talk about, looked really serious. I thought gonna ask divorce something. But something along lines of, “honey, I you’ve working late past week, I understand you’ve lot plate work. But I’ve eat cup noodles hot pockets last night”. So basically I “slacking” “paying price it”. I perfectly capable finding something else himself. And argued bit made up. But I decided stop chores anything. And house became mess, he’s whining TV dinners he’s eating. And since I haven’t grocery shopping we’re also getting low those. He finally broke apologized appreciative. He’s since changed tune. But I acting a, “B-word weeks”. I feel way appreciative though. It lasted weeks. Not months. That typo. We work full He’s helping latelyPET TAX: [https://imgur.com/a/2H4PI4X](https://imgur.com/a/2H4PI4X) Edit: I meant PRESSING CHARGES, sue. Sorry wording mistake. I speak English fluently, I apologize If I wrote results confusing. My dog, Maximo Tiberio, rescue dog. He lot aggression problems. As result, vet recommended training muzzle. The muzzle dog ​​wears totally comfortable him, hurt anything. So far good results. I take dog ​​to dog park every Monday, along 11-year-old daughter. I took dog ​​to dog park I normally do, wearing muzzle. I keep eye him, checking signs trouble. Suddenly, I hear girl cry, daughter field vision, I worried. I tie Maximo area specifically designated purpose, I move 15m away search daughter. I find (it crying) I return Maximo I see girl running towards him, takes arms runs back car. Max visibly stressed muzzle anything. The park almost empty, around stop I reach her, I took picture license plate. I went police station, there, identified owner car sent patrol look dog. A day later, police returns girl Maximo, deplorable state, nervous anxious. There, girl explains took Maximo thinks I abusing watches every Monday uses muzzle will. Regardless reasoning, matter noble is, I decided I sue anyway. The stress I felt, along state Maximo returned, reason enough sue her. My sister another opinion. She says I horrible person suing someone thought right thing girl took risk save dog believed abused, admirable. Some friends agree her. I still sue her, I perspective see I wrong..A nights ago wife I woken neighbors apartment ***very*** explicitly loudly trying expand family. They must going hour, fairly frustrating I work next day. After done I played applause track Bluetooth speaker held ceiling try make aware relative thinness floor. I found today reported management harassment. So Reddit, AITA?My friend raising money build orphanage home country. He’s going host auction fund raiser asked friends anything donate. I engagement ring beautiful holds painful memories me. My ex I broke 3 years ago. I’ve contacted multiple times past asking either take it, give new address I can send agree selling it. He hasn’t responded requests 3 years I finally decided rid donating fund raiser. I sent ex final warning I going rid ring ignored I gave friend. I even sent ex confirmation text let I longer ring, weeks ago never responded. On Saturday showed home looking furious. I shocked see him, I kept asking gave address. I guess annoyed stupid question demanded I give ring. I explained I longer ring I given plenty opportunities last 3 years collect it. He back I I couldn’t. He asked I idea much ring worth reminded grandmother’s. I ring important should’ve responded messages came collect since obviously knew I lived. He gave *because* important, known I spiteful give away would've come back it. We kept arguing I regret I didn’t ring back end week. I wanted back badly, bid late. He eventually left telling I week ring back “or else”. Obviously, thinks I’m AH speaking sister might right, I gave plenty opportunities take ring back important him, would’ve. He also can 100% afford bid win back, I don’t feel bad refusing ask back since money will go worthy cause. AITA?Yesterday, I bit altercation wife. I work home, always since pandemic. I family live older Victorian era home east coast. I wife bought almost 20 years ago market price, boy fixer upper. Eventually repaired much reasonable. One room proper study, complete gorgeous built book shelves, centuries old furniture. I promptly made office bussiness. Time passed, now family together. Here comes conflicts. 1. We currently 3 children. 16m, 8f, 6f. I two youngest ones come study. Mostly I often paint models many fragile art prices their, I honestly trust youngest keep hands themselves. This resulted accusations sexism wife, I always allowed boy In me. I case, I let around 11or 12 years old. 2. After conflict, now insists calling office "man cave". I really title. It implies room exists purely pleasure. An implication false, I work. I communicated bassicly stop sensitive. I help see self reasonable, I thought I'd ask reddit.My husband deployed overseas I newborn 3 old niece myself. (I taking care older sister incarcerated). I family friends around help give break. I’m already part some. I’m utterly exhausted NO sleep schedule/routine kids (especially newborn) expectedly demanding. To point I feel I’m going throw I don’t rest I can. My husband met somebody overseas stationed base. He says wife lives here, pregnant, ill (he says mental illness severe PTSD/anxiety), drive anywhere. He volunteered drive around early AM appointments without asking first. He loves helping people. I it. But that’s I’m “what me?” When called I “no.” I physically put extra work take care another human (especially adult I know) upset already mate I help them. I can’t. I genuinely unless lose little sanity I left. I doesn’t seem think I’m hard easily help somebody need. I running fumes figured manage I have. The extra work quite literally break me. He thinks I’m extremely insensitive I feel I needed help nobody help me. I I needed help thinks I’m overdramatic. The mate now disappointed wife nobody bring appointment early morning. AITA?[removed]Basically couple months ago (f19) sister (30) telling mom really tight budget wedding couldn’t afford big wedding dreamt for. So I offered help find cheaper alternatives decorations wanted. She asked make bridesmaids custom baskets robes names less half charge couldn’t find someone make cheap enough price agreed. Eventually managed save lot able dress originally wanted. I figured everything else fine last week. My sister decided kids wedding wanted adults enjoy drink. I still thought nothing sudden change longer invited wedding. When asked considered “kid” since can’t drink. She still invited wedding rehearsal that’s it. I since wasn’t invited wedding find someone else custom robes + gift baskets pay full price it. This meant return dress everything else wedding already cheapest find. Both mom dad says i’m petty still shes sister. Her fiancé also called self centered childish brother agreed him.
